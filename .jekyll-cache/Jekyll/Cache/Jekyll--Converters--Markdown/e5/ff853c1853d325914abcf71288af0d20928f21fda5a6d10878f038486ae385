<p><strong>Accessing the representational accuracy of GlobeLand30â€™s classification of Mexicoâ€™s Forest.</strong></p>

<p>Chair: Dr. Rafael Moreno</p>

<p>Committee: Dr Galen Maclaurian, Dr. Peter Athamathem, Dr. Jaun Manuel Torres Rojo</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This work represents a validation of a remote sensing derived global land cover dataset using a ground verified series of forest inventory sites. Through this process, I have done extensive research on the development and limitations of remote sensing derive land cover maps, validation methodology for land cover maps, and potential sources of errors in both the imagery and the validation sets. Overall it is a very detail examination of how well a Landsat
product can represent a land cover.</p>

Through this work, I have made multiple public presentations, learned and exercised field-based scientific research, proposed and obtained funding for 14C dating of soil organic matter. Geomorphic landforms were field mapped using GPS, digitized, and expanded on based on the interpretation of high resolution remotely sensed data.</p>
