<h3 id="audience">Audience</h3>
<p>Audience is a group ranging from professionals to students who are interested in GIS and probably know very little about CWRs. I know this from knowing the venue that Iâ€™m presenting at.</p>
<h3 id="take-home-message">Take home message</h3>
<p>Take home message is loud and clear. There is a challenge and geospatial knowledge is needed.</p>
<h3 id="format">Format</h3>
<p>This will be presentation but Iâ€™m building it around a story of a well know crop. Iâ€™m framing in around the SSI of genetic modification and suggesting a right and less dramatic alternative to the current process.</p>

<h3 id="relevancy">Relevancy</h3>
<p>This is really about the future of food and how folks in this audience can help. At the end I tie there skills to part of the solution.</p>

<h3 id="creative">Creative</h3>
<p>There is a lot of room for growth in this area but itâ€™s a start. As the presentation comes together I think there will be a lot of opportunity to make it something more creative. Specifically showing visualizations of the problem at hand.</p>
