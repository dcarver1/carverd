<p>No one really wants to be put in a box. It’s easy to get defensive if someone were to classify you, real or not. So it makes bit a sense to me that using some form of character typing such as a Myers Breggs test is not often meet with lots of enthusiasm.
Many individuals I have spoken with about character typing have found that the process does not seem to add much to their work. To me it seems that two factors can explain much of that sentiment. First, the tests often force the individual to make generalized statements that don’t really apply across all settings. It’s rare to hear a statement about yourself and you bounce forth with pride, “That’s me exactly”. Like all interesting questions, the answer depends on the circumstances. The second factor is that often the result of these tests are spoken of very little if at all after the factor. It’s real to see them work their way into the work place culture. While this is by no means an inclusive list of why people don’t like character typing, I think it covers a lot. Understand why people do not like the process helps define how to make it better for them. These test are simple and if employed well can be great tools for framing discussions on teamwork and conflict.</p>
