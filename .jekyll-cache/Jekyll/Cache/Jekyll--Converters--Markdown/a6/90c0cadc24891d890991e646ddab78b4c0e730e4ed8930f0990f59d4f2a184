<p>There is not a better word out there.
If your here I hope you find some of this material useful. My goal in maintaining this site is to provide a resource to learn from to help grow a stronger community of spatial scientist.
Learning is a two way street so if you see something you like and something that could be improved please reach out with questions or comments.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-bio">A Brief Bio</h2>
<p>I came to Colorado in 2007, mostly for the mountains, but also to study Geology at Adams State College in Alamosa. I immediately became involved in the Adventure Program and did as much as I could to travel and learn from the landscape and people of the West. My original degree turned in to two and I graduated with a B.S. in Geology and a B.A. in Physical Geography in 2012. Through the excellent guidance of Dr. Jared Beeton and the support of the Earth Science department was able to produce a publication based on an independent research projection involving Soils and Geoarchaeology within the Upper Rio Grande Basin. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033589414000702">Science Direct</a>

<p>After graduating, I worked for the Ambassadors for Wilderness program at Great Sand Dunes National Park. In this role I lead an amazing team of people and we ran 5 and 7 days backcountry trips for middle school and high school students from the San Luis Valley. The goal of the program was to teach them about public land management and provide an opportunity for personal growth. Not surprisingly, I left that work with a tremendous respect for the role of our public lands and a conviction to continue to educate and learn as much as I could. I also got my 5 minutes of fame by having photo of myself and three other participants on the Wilderness homepage of the National Park Service. <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/wilderness/index.htm">wilderness home page</a>

I worked as an experiential educator for the following three years for organizations such as the Colorado Mountain Club, the Cottonwood Institute, and the Albuquerque Academy before making the choice to move back to the sciences.
In 2015 I start a program in Applied Geography and Geospatial Science at the University of Colorado Denver. Through the degree I work with Dr. Rafael Moreno evaluating how well a global land cover data captured the diversity of forest in the Mexico. The process gave me an appreciate for method development and statistical evaluation that I continue to pull from in my current work. After graduating in 2017 I took a position with the NASA DEVELOP program in Fort Collins, Colorado. My role as a geoinformatics fellow allows me to apply my knowledge based in the spatial sciences and experiences working as a education to support 10 week feasibility studies conducted by the thirteen  NASA DEVELOP nodes across the country.</p>

<p>Looking forward I will continue to seek opportunities that allow me to learn from others, help my peers and colleagues grow, and explore spatial questions that matter.</p>

<p>I built this site using Jekyll and Iâ€™m hosting it on Github. There were two resources that very much help me generate this site.
