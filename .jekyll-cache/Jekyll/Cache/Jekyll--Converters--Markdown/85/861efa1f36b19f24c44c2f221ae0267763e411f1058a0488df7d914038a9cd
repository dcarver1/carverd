<p>Iâ€™ve been interested in digital design sense being exposed to good cartography. The truth of the matter is people enjoy looking at images that are appealing to the eyes. So I learned pretty quick that if you want your work seen, make it look good. While there is a lot of creativity involved, there is a bit of a form to it all. Maps, data tables, charts, and figures all have the purpose of conveying data. This past year I was face with a new challenge. Make a series of 13 posters that showcase all the NASA DEVELOP locations. I saw 13 11x17 blank canvases and knew it was time to learn.</p>
