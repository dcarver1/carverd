<p>When it comes down to it, I find land cover maps to be one of the most intriguing maps. This is in part from the respect to the process that goes into the development of those products but also just the information they hold.
Come fall I always pull up the National Land Cover Dataset and see if I can find a good aspen patch to go exploring in. Theses maps are generally used for very practical purposes in research and planning so the goal is to make all the classes visually distinct. The result of this is a rather abstracted landscape that does not really look much like the real world. A usefully map, but not the most engaging.</p>
