I"ô<p>Iâ€™ve never have had much luck reading anthologies. While there is a theme through the book, the lack of central and unifying direction means I often leave them half finish or half started. At the same time, where else can you get such a collection of thoughts or exposure to the new works of authors. My solution, take the time to write about each piece that I read. I believe that the act of adding my own thoughts and reactions will tie the work together in a way that keeps me motivated.</p>
