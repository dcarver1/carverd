<p>My go to hobby these days is Disc Golf. It’s similar in form to ball golf, complete the course in as few shots as possible, but the player throws specialized disc. There’s a lot of other differences as well; accessibility, cost, and culture to name some of the big ones. I would say most people enjoy playing disc golf because it gets them outside and watching the disc fly is really quite a sight.
When I moved to the Denver metro area, I suddenly had access to numerous disc golf courses and I found myself spending time trying to find out which one I would take the time to travel to. The natural step for me was to look at the course maps.</p>

<p>I felt disappointed time and time again when I starting searching for new course. Maps excite me. They help me feel engaged in a place. They are the start of a story and a preview of the world that is out there. I looked at map after map for these disc golf courses and physically felt my excitement deflate. They were utilitarian at best and detrimental at worst. So the idea started to burn in me as I went ventured further and played more and more course. What would it take to make a good disc golf map? This little pet project boiled in my head for some time before it came to life.</p>
