 Excellent words from people I have learned from.

### Ursula K. Le Guin
#### *Late in the Day*
> science describes accurately from outside, poetry describes accurately from inside, both celebrate what they describe.

### Theodore Roosevelt
#### *Duties of the Citizen*
>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeatâ€¦ The man who does nothing cuts the same sordid figure in the pages of history, whether he be a cynic, or fop, or voluptuary. There is little use for the being whose tepid soul knows nothing of great and generous emotion, of the high pride, the stern belief, the lofty enthusiasm, of the men who quell the storm and ride the thunder.

### Fritjof Capra and Pier Luigi Luisi
#### *The Systems View of Life*
The problem, as already mentioned, is that Intelligent Design is spreading, carrying with itself ignorance and misconceptions about science. Its success is due to a combination of factors; but, basically, it rests on the fact that preaching ignorance and fear is rather efficient in convincing uncritical, simple-minds listeners; and this is combined with a philosophy well rooted in fundamentalism, and turned into a political movement, with political lobbies, usually associated with wealthy, ring-wing politicians. To fight against this cloud of falsehood should be the duty of any scientist who cares for accuracy and the respect of reason. It is the old battle between Galileo and the clergy, the eternal fight against blindness and superstition.
