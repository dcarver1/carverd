Finding direction in a world inundated with information can be more far more challenging than it sounds. Not having a clear path for your exploration of life leaves you susceptible to the rapid and dynamic fluctuations of modern culture. Rapid changes in your direction can be detrimental to the development of oneself because gaining mastery of any practice requires sustained and persistent effort and attention to that feature.

In an interview with Yuval Noah Harari, a student poses the question, "What suggestions do you have for individual learners to become better self-guided learners." Harari concludes that his self-learning method was to; "Focus on the most important questions and allow the questions to lead him where ever they go." I brought this advice into my year-end planning. I'm making an effort here to explain the significance of this idea to me.

Start with a big question that is meaningful and relevant to you. Write it down. Come back to it. Try to formalize it into something real. Something that is within your reach and ready. A good question will rest well at the tip of your tongue. As you work, be aware of when that question arises. What was the connection that brought your big question to mind? Realize that this question is significant for you to understand, so it is worth taking steps to follow up and gain some understanding from the new connection.

This pursuit is not about finding the answer as much as observing and reflecting on where those steps take you. What experiences are leaving you breadcrumbs of an answer? Let this habit of recognition, pursuit, and reflection become part of your everyday life.

If it's a big enough question, it's unlikely that you'll be able to answer it by only evaluating a single discipline. You will have to chase the ideas that support the answer. Doing so will bring you to new places and new concepts that highlight elements of the world that may have been foreign to you. Engaging with a broad perspective on an idea can lead to the realization that the answer you seek is probably quite complex, and it is unlikely you will find a solution to your big question that always works. Still, you can develop a sense of understanding of the actions that lead to the result. Real-life experience is what allows you to create this type of quality-focused knowledge.

During my yearly reflection, I made an effort to formalize one of these big questions. How to live a life? I don't know the answer to that question. In fact, I feel far from understanding what precisely I'm asking. Is this about personal character, the actions we take, the choices we make, or most likely all of these above and more?

So far, two primary themes are developing in my search.

> Experience is what matters.

> Value creation over consumption.

These are not new ideas, but connecting them to my big question gives them a new priority. It moves them closer to my concept of self, or maybe I'm just moving closer to them. Whichever way it is, it feels good. It's a self-defined movement based on an understanding of the structure of the world at hand. It is mine, and it started with a big question.
