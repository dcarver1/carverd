Teaching, Learning, and Markdown?

I read this quick article today by because the "Feynman Technique" interested me. Feynman is a well know and rather eccentric physicist who is respected for his advancement of the field as well as his ability to communicate science to those learning it. The "Feynmen lectures" written in 1959 are still a dependable resource for those clawing through their introductory physics coursework. Considering this individuals role in science communication, I felt that this Feynman Technique could be a worth while framework.

The basic framework is as follows
1.  Spend time developing a personal understanding on the topic
2. explain the process as if your teaching
3. Demonstrate processes through examples
4. Reassess personal understanding

There is nothing crazy about this process. Learn, explain, show, and evaluate. If you've worked in the educational field at all this sounds like a bread and butter process. So Feynman is famous and I don't know when this technique was push out to the world but I doubt that he has been the only person to independently claim that teaching is an essential part of the learning process. So it's his technique.

At the same time, how often do we follow through with that connection. I personally know I hear the idiom "Those who can, do; those who can't, teach" more then "Teaching is an integral aspect of the learning process". So if it seems obvious to you the reality is that connection is by no means obvious to everyone.

Ok, to try it back to something a bit more tangible. At this point in time, I write a lot of code. I use code to connect data to ideas. Those ideas are then transferred to those who don't have the time or interest to complete that middle step themselves. So what real incentive due I have to "explain or demonstrate" how I got to the end product when the reason I'm working is to cover that middle step?

At this point, I think that personal motivation is really enough. It's enough because extending your code to incorporate an explaining and demonstrating component is easy when you write in markdown.

- show an example that illustrates the following point
1. plain text commits
2. providing links and example code that does not run
3. pulling in imagery as examples


I understand that markdown is not really going to work for everyone. Jupyter notebooks really seem to be the option that most people are going for. Pick your cup of tea. At the end of the day this is about getting more out of your work. If you can teach your content you understand it more completely. Increase your understanding and you will enjoy your work more and be better able to speak to your abilities. So while Feynman probably didn't spend much time writing in markdown, I think he would respect your effort to make more approachable.
