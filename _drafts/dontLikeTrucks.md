# Interstate Wisdom
The interstate system is at the core of the American economy. From personal travel to movement of goods this system of roads defines the movement of materials and to a significant extent the distribution of our cities. For as important as they are to the function of our economy that are also an intinsic part of our cultural identity.
For better or worst as a culure we drive. We drive a lot. Many of these miles pile up at high speed rushing past mile markers and blurring together white and yellow lines. The routine and light focus that we can develop often puts us drivers into comtemplative moods. Providing sometime to think and mullover all the ideas we are often to busy to engage with. I believe it's one of the many things that keeps us driving on and on.

The troublesome component of being in this thinking state ofmind on the highway is the simuluse around us. Aggression is often the emotion that fills us as we ride along interacting with other drivers and their vehicals. These intersates become hotspots for advertisements of all types. Pulling our eyes and attention on to something we didn't ask to be exposured to. It is a place to think but not often a place where you alone get to choose your thoughts.

There are time though when a message comes through and truly engages your mind. I think of quirky bumberstickers. populations sizes signs of passing towns, or the feeling of finally seeing your exit after a long ride. It is the combination of the drivers internal state, the placement, and timing of such signs that can really get the brian going and provide some thing all significan all on it's own. Interstate wisdom is what I like to think of it as. Below a one that was such a gift to me.

The image is a little blurry, a side effect of traveling at nearly 80 mph. But the statement is clear.
> Don't like trucks? Stop buying shit. Problem solved.

I passed this big rig, gave him a fist bump or two hoping he take it as a positive gesture and mulled that statement over my head over the next 3 hours of interstate driving.
Problem solve! it's as easy as that. Just stop buying shit. We won't need so many trucks and you all can be happier. I love every bit of it because to me it hits the core of our problems. We buy shit non stop. It doesn't just define our interstates but our communities and our lifestyles. There is a whole line of thought that quicky devolves into the interconnectedness of all our systems and I don't really want to go there now. Maybe that what was so nice about this little piece of wisdom. It summed up that complexity into three lines. So at the end the day, I still kinda like big rigs. They are impressive machines and are the core of our economy. That said, I might have to jump on board with those who don't like trucks, if they take that wisdom to heart and promote the mission of buying less shit.
