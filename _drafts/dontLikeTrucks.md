# Interstate Wisdom
The interstate system is at the core of the American economy. From personal travel to movement of goods this system of roads defines the movement of materials and to a significant extent the distribution of our cities. For as important as they are to the function of our economy, I believe that interstates also are an intrinsic part of our cultural identity.
For better or worst as a culture we drive. We drive a lot. Many of these miles pile up at highway speeds rushing past mile markers and blurring together white and yellow lines. The routine and light focus that we can develop while driving often puts us drivers into contemplative moods. Providing sometime to think and mull over all the ideas we are often to busy to engage with. I believe this time for soft focus it's one of the many things that keeps us driving on and on.

The troublesome component of being in this thinking state of mind on the highway is the stimulus around us. Aggression is often the emotion that fills us as we ride along interacting with other drivers and their vehicles. These interstates become hotspots for advertisements of all types. Pulling our eyes and attention on to something we didn't ask to be exposed to. It is a place to think but not often a place where you alone get to choose your thoughts.

Not all messages you experience on the are bad or unwelcomed. There are time a message comes through and truly engages your mind. I think of quirky bumper stickers, populations sizes signs of passing towns, or the feeling of finally seeing your exit after a long ride. It is the combination of the drivers internal state, the placement, and timing of such signs that can really get the brain going and provide some thing significant in it's own right. I call this Interstate Wisdom. Below a one piece of that I still consider such a gift.

The image is a little blurry, a side effect of traveling at nearly 80 mph. But the statement is clear.
> Don't like trucks?
Stop buying shit.
Problem solved.

I passed this big rig, gave him a fist bump or two hoping he take it as a positive gesture and mulled that statement over my head over the next 3 hours of interstate driving.
Problem solve! it's as easy as that. Just stop buying shit. We won't need so many trucks and you all can be happier. I love every bit of it because to me it hits the core of our cultural and ecological challenges. We buy shit non stop. The statement doesn't just define our interstates but our communities and our lifestyles. Thinking about the interconnectedness of issues that stems from our want of thinks quickly pushes me into a feeling a genuine doom and I don't really want to go there now. Better to leave it with that little piece of wisdom. It summed up all that complexity and interconnected into three lines. Heck, it even gave us a common enemy, those slow moving trucks.

If found another more tactful summary of the problem describe in " Guide to the Good Life" by William Irving
> For one thing, modern individuals rarely see the need to adopt a philosophy of life. They instead tend to spend their days working hard to be able to afford the latest consumer gadget, in the resolute belief that if only they buy enough stuff, they will have a life that is both meaningful and maximally fulfilling.

I still like big rigs even if they are slow. They are impressive machines and I deeply appreciate the role they play in supporting the quality of life in our nation. That said, I jump ship to join those who don't like trucks, if they take that wisdom to heart and promoted the mission of buying less shit.
