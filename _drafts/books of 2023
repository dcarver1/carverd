## Books of 2022

I read much less this year then in years past. There are a few reasons for this that all center around my prioritization of reading and writing.

The best book of the year was The Moral Animal by Robert Wright. A introduction to modern Darwinism, this was almost painfully enlightening. Much like the games changes of the past (Jared Diamond/ Yuval Noah Harari) Wright give so much context on what is means to be a human.
