The diversity of skills required for this position imply a successful applicant must have proven experience maintaining professional relationships, organizing groups of individuals, collecting and maintaining detailed records/data, applying spatial analysis, and communicating the quality work of the organization to others. While there is always room for improvement, I am confident in my competency in being able to effectively contribute to all necessary aspect of this position.

I understand that the success of a project is based on the groups willingness to be inclusive, collaborate, respect others time, and maintain a share vision. Within the realm of water resource management my educational background in the geology and geography afforded me an understand of ground and surface water systems.

My time at Adams State and professional experiences within the SLV has given me a series of professional connections within the region. My recent work with the NASA DEVELOP program has given me ample opportunities to organize and direct groups of people around a common goal.

Public outreach is something I greatly enjoy and give considerable thought to.

**and a statement of the Applicant’s willingness to become or remain a full time resident of the San Luis Valley**
- former resident
- wife is currently working in SLV
- Looking for a stable long term job that will allow me to support a family.

The San Luis Valley is an isolated and rural place with extremely cold winters and springs that make you dream of a calm day. It is not for everybody. I lived in the SLV for 6 years and I understand the challenges and benefits that come with the place. I have maintained both a personal and profession community within the valley. My wife, who was raised in the SLV, is the book keeper for her families excavation business (Potter Excavation) in Crestone. For the past two years she has been traveling to the SLV to spend 10 days on month in Crestone to complete the in-person requirements of the job. While I try my best to be down there with her, it is not the long term arrangement we wish for. To this we are hoping on starting a family and both see immense benefit in giving the opportunity for our children to grow up near the extended family and in a rural area. While the list can go on I just want to state again that my personal character is largely a reflection of the relationships and experiences I had while living in the SLV. I'm proud to be from there and I want to call it home again.
