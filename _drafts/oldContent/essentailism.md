I had high hopes when I picked up this book. The core idea seemed straightforward, focus time
energy on the things that really matter. It's another push against the cultural norm of doing more and more. I thought it was what I wanted to read about. The truth is I still do it's just that this book did not work for me. Interestingly it took the idea of pursuing less and stuck to a tremendous list of qualities. Nearly all of the 20 chapters had a list of multiple aspects.
Non essentialist
- forfeits the right to choose
Essentialist
- Exercises the power of choice
This might be helpful for a summary but to me it felt like a an effective dilution of what an essentialist is. This may just be a feature of not being able to keep 50+ qualities organized in my mind at once. Maybe if I was an essentialist I could. ;)
Beyond that I found I never quite connected with the examples provided. I found the personal stories a but more compelling but I don't believe the CEO are the end all be all when it comes to mentors and people to go to for advice.
I will say I enjoyed the layout and the graphical elements of the book quite a lot. It's a nice one to flip through. I wouldn't go so far as to tell people not to read it, but I will not be recommending it to other. Too much breath and not enough depth for me.
