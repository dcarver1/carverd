handlenotes for the upcoming interview

- I think it is great that we have a city managed electrical network. It means that the money we pay into the utility goes direct to the people that work here and paying back the infrastructure investments already made, not shareholders or wealthy company owners.

- Most utilities, public works in general are built to handle the maximum load. What that means is that for non peak time the system is over built. No one complains about traffic at 6am. I imagine this is the same with our electric utility. What this means is that the true cost of the electric infrastructure is a product of cumulative effect of all users pulling energy during peak use. By promoting a more distributive use of energy we can effectly decrease the total system cause for all.

- Change in perception is the essential component to dealing with complex issues. The variable rate structure forces people to think about the actual cost of the energy they rely on everyday.

- I'm proud to live in a community that is implementing changes that incentives people to think about their energy us within a bigger system then just the efficiency of their own appliances
