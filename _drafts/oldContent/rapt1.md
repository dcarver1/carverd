# Introduction: Choosing the Focused Life


> I'll live the focused life, because it's the best kind there is.
page 14

This is the last line of the chapter but is also the primary theme of the book. Through focus we can define the quality of our life. This is supported by the fact that focus allows one to control what the mind is doing. Controlling the mind allow one to live in the present moment. Being in the present give us the agency to gain control over our actions. This agency allow us to build our own sense of well being.
Like most processes, it is easier said then done. The author was motivated by a major life effect of battling cancer to build her will of living a focused life. It seems her goal for this book is to prove that you don't need to be fighting for your life to take control and focus.  

# Chapter 1: Pay Attention: Your Life Depends on It

We can only concentrate an a small portion of the stimulus the world provides. As a result our lives are filled with features that are either *in focus* or *out of focus*

There are two mechanisms by which our attention can be captured.
**Bottom up attention** Stimulus that appeals to our base level want for novelty and uniqueness. This is a the core tactic of advertisement and is generally something we do not have control over. This type of attention takes like or no mental energy so we always have to deal with it.

**top down attention** the individual deciding what to focus on. The brain understand the character of the stimulus and makes that the feature that will most readily stand out. This attention requires focus and as a result requires mental energy, of which we have a limited store. The result is that can be limited by the amount of top down attention we can muster.

The relationship between the forms of attention is not a light switch but rather a dial. As we choose to focus in on a specific feature we end up dialing back the attentional attractiveness of the all other features.

Paying attention to specific features allows us to build a memory store of that features characteristics. The result is the ability to readily make decision about the quality of that feature with out applying much thought. Without focused attention it is not possible to store the details need to create the mental library.

When you focus you essentially narrow your perspective. Most things outside the direct features of focus become blurry and soft. You memory account by that by filling in the surrounds with generic features from past events. This is why memories can seem full but details are only extractable from the features of focus.

## Chapter 2: Inside Out: Feeling Frame Focus

Strong emotions heighten our ability to focus. As a result emotional response are readily used to draw attention.

*Negativity Bias Theory* is the idea that we pay more attention to the bad thing then the good.

This come about as an evolutionary tactic to bring attention to potential threats. Yet in todays safe world the negativity we focus on is not often life threatening and more often then not is just a source of distraction.

Negative emotional responses tends to push our attention to a small very focused feature, the thing cause the emotional response. On the other end, positive emotional responses cause a widening of focus. This means that if you focus on the positive aspects of life you end up experiencing more of the world. Amazing!

The relationship between attention and cognition falls within three categories.
*Reactive* : biological responses to stimuli, more or less automatic functions
*Behavioral* : Learned patterns that can be done with little cognitive effort
*Reflective* : Higher level function that requires active attention and focus
For the most part the two lower level categories; reactive and behavioral can account for the majority of all the actions which we make in a day.

This ties in really well the 'Deep Work' idea, in that learning and creating require reflective attention and focus. Other mundane task can be learn and ran more or less through behavioral attention.

While attention does imply a conscious experience our action can be influences by features we take in but do not perceive. The thought it that these experience might be receive by the amygdala.


## Chapter 3
> Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side. Keep on the sunny side of life.
It'll help you day by day. It'll brighten all the way.
If you keep on the sunny side of life.

I felt that these lines describe the sentiment of this chapter well. We have the opportunity to alter our well being by changing what it is we spend time focusing on. There are a lot of good examples of this effect. An interesting one was that the elderly are often better able to find the good. This has to do with the understand that life is either mostly ahead of you or mostly behind.
Very valuable thought.

## Chapter 4 Born to Focus
It is clear that focus effects out outlook on life. This chapter goes into the detail about how underlying character traits effect focus.
For instance if you classify yourself as an introvert or extravert will change who you place your focus.
This can be summed down to how much you are going to pay attention to your outward or inward environment. It was interesting that they "Knowledge workers" as a very introverted group. That fits well with the deep work idea.

Beyond personality type we're inclined to have either
*Respondent* : following a structure
*Experimental*: Pursuing the novel.
draw to focus. As with everything else, individuals fall on a spectrum between these extremes. Successful individuals have the ability to move back and forth through the perspective. Both as valuable and there are bad traits to each as well.
>Technique is what you fall back on when you run out of inspiration.
Rudolf Nureyev

Much like the training of the body or off intelligence research is finding that attention as a system can also be strengthened. The brains attention system is split into three parts
*Alerting*
*Orienting*
*Executive*  
Beyond helping maintain a sense of place the orienting attentional network also contributes to the willingness of individual to focus on the pleasure of small opportunities. A good apple or a pleasant breeze. People who are more focus on the small opportunities are often more happier.
The executive attentional network fits well with the idea of will power. Choosing what to focus on when.
The important message is that we do have power to adapt and define how be apply our attention. Over time this will improve, if it is done deliberately.

# Chapter 5 Nurture: This Is Your Brain on Attention
What catches our attention is based in part on what we focus on.
The best way to grow this relationship is by practicing meditation. After all there are not real negative effects. If you meditate on positive feeling you will end up being more responsive to them in the long run. This is not an over night transformation, it needs to a consistent practice.  

### extract
Just want to get this out.
I've been hooked on the systems thinking process for some time now but I still struggle with talking to people about it. Even talking to may self about it. I think this is partly due to not writing about it. I've read 3 books and multiple papers on the process but I don't have any real notes about it. Tisk tisk.
Anywhere there was something I read today in my systems view of life book that stood out to me.
Part of the process or the structure.
that is not a quote and frankly I'm not sure if the works process and structure are correct. But they seem to work.
In the Cartesian method of thought which is still the dominate one. Everything is attempted to be view in isolation. Sysytems view of life has been going though and providing example of how other are starting to break from that method of thought and take on the whole is greater then the sum of its parts idea.
This idea of process and structure struck me as a core means of explaining that idea.
No feature stands alone, it is either a part of a structure or a part of a process. If it is a structure or a function depends mostly on what scale the feature is viewed at.
This does meld a bit with the form or function idea that is common speak, thought I not sure how closely tied that is to either the cartisian or systems philosophy.
Defining all features as either a structure or function removes the ability to speak of individuals. With out the individual everything is a system. This seems like a core concept. We wrok with individuals because they are easier to measure the system they are a part of. This allows the emergent properties of systems to have a place even though they don't have a part of a structure. They are not a stand alone individual but a process of a stucture  or a process of a process. This train of thought inherently pushes attention outward toward the more complex features.
Process and Structure
Structure and process
That is all there is.

# Chapter 5: Nurture: This is Your Brian on Attention

Focusing self-referential processing is what most of us do most the time. That we focus on ourself. While good and bad come of that the big thing is that we are often our biggest critic. As a result we self-referential processing is more likely to generate a negative feeling and we begin to focus on that negativity.  
> Sensitive attention is a key substrate of successful social interactions, and the consequences of missing that kind of information can be quite significant.
page 70 Davidson

An argument is made that the cultural division between Eastern and Western societies is in part due to where their cultural tend to focus their attention. The more family focus cultural of eastern nations is often spoken of but hearing this association give some form of cause to lean on.
A clear message coming through is that your brain is adaptable and can change if you are active about changing your environment and your focus.

# Chapter 6: Relationships: attending to Different Worlds

> paying attention is an individual effort, but it's also a kind of social cement that holds groups together and helps them feel part of something greater than themselves.
page 85
>>>>>>> 92fa0d68c2cddb4f97d0a2a35fde23812b0a8f51

The theme of this chapter seems to be that there are great benefits that can be reaped by paying attention to others rather then spending that time in self-referential thought. This is shown through a case study of American families which highlighted the specific interactions between family members. The fact is the culture in the US push kids into a sheltered individualism that makes the interactions between parents feel one dimensional. This hit home as I reflected on my own upbringing. Much of this is driving by the substantial undercurrent of American culture that is the prospect of finical success and material wealth. The message is that most individuals don't assess how training their children to success is effecting their families quality of life. Simple message is be less busy and spend more time with family.  

> The more I know that my partner's interests run with my own, the less I feel threatened bu differences, even in arguments, and the more we can forge a common view of reality and focus on each other."
page 97

This whole chapter is excellent and really fits well with the conversations I have within my own relationships. After reading this I wanted to buy the book so I have access to the chapter again in the future.

## Chapter 7: Productivity: Work Zone

Staying focused is key to being productive. There is cultural shift that is pushing more individuals to pursue jobs that allow them to find well being through work not just the largest paycheck. To stay focus individuals need to activities that are at the edge of that intellectual/physical abilities.

> You know you're in the right business if you feel that you'd work "for the sheer pleasure": an intrinsic reward that's far more satisfying than extrinsic ones such as a big salary and professional recognition, which depend on comparisons with others.
page 103

This was a very strong statement that connected a lot of the themes within this book, focus is an internal factor that you can set regardless of your surrounding. This is great because it put the onus on the individual not their community. Takes away a lot of potential excuses.

> Happiness is a later reflection of the flow, rather than the result of the experience at the time.
page 106

> Those who learn to control their inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives, which is as close as any of us can come to being happy
page 106   

Again statements that really give a lot of power to the individual. Also an interesting note that things that make us happy are not necessarily things that we enjoy at in the moment, but things we can reflect on as experience with a high level of engagement. This is only slightly true in my mind but gives credence to the type 2 fun notion.

> If most of the time you're not particularly concerned about whether what you're doing is work or play, or even whether you're happy or not, you know you're living the focused life.
page 114


# chapter 8: Decisions: Focusing Illusions
These chapters keep getting better and better. Here is a question I want to use.

> Let's say you're invited to toss a coin. The terms are that if it's tails, you lose twenty dollars; heads, you win a certain amount. If you're then asked how much your winnings would have to be to make you take the chance, you're likely to suggest between forty and fifty dollars. in other words, because we put more weight on the loss than the reward, before taking a 50/50 gamble, most people want to know that they'd win at least twice as much as they'd forfeit.

So interesting to hear it all spelled out. We weight the losses and negatives of a situation far more significantly. I was talking politic with the family right after reading this and I heard this reality shine through. We talk about the bad things, focus on the negatives, to the point that they significantly influence out ability to a good decision on the process. When you dicuss friend or families you don't talk long about the individuals who are successing and making good choice. You take extensively about those whom see most inclined to make the poorest choice and have the most negitive effort on thier community. They get our attention. WHY

> Your hands-on "experience self", Which concentrates on just plain being in the here and now, is absorbe din whatever is going on and how you feel about it without doing much analysis. Your evaluative "remembering self," however, looks back on an experience, focuses on its emotional high points and outcomes, then formulates thoughts about it, not always accurately.
page 119

How we experience the world and how we remember it are very different. Our remembering self is most influence by the highs, the lows, and the objectives. From those subset of what acutally happen you build up impression of the past that will be influenced by how the question is phrase or your current emotional state.

The difference between a pleasure and a comfort is one of a focus. When we get interested in a new thing we are attracted to the new and novel aspects that the item will bring. Over time we spend less and less attention on that new and novel and it simply becomes the standard. The result is that the benifit or pleasure of such a feature is rather short lived. Therefore it's suggested that items aquired for pleasure be inheretly short lived. Bottle of wine or flowers. Features that you will focus on for the short time they are around and be happy with. This like a new apartment or home are going to loss there edge overtime. Just understand that the new and novel only last as long as you can focus on them.

Making decision can be stressful. This is mostly because we feed information about the features that is not really important. IF your gadget does the primary task it's suppose to do isn't that good enough. Focusing on the extras detracts from what is actually significant about the choice.
>The problem is that by focusing on those often minor variations, you dramatically inflate their real importance. Even trivial distinctions soon loom large enough to obscure the fact that for all practical purposes, the gizmos are nearly identical. depending on the number under consideration, this process can be a major waste of time and energy.
page 128

Part of why we have so much trouble dealing with these choices is that were so frequently exposed to advertisement that our beliefs and wants become hijacked by marketing's drive to sell things. We have some choice in how much exposure to marketing we see and also we can decide what attention we need to give it.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Hi Catherine,
I had a few questions about the contract work for your group that was recently released.
Are you looking for someone to work part time over an extended period or would a more concentrated effort be better?
I graduated with my masters in May of 2017. I believe the government definition of recent graduate is within 2 years of graduation. Would I still be able to qualify for the work?

## Chapter 9 Creativity: An Eye for Detail

> As she says, in painting, gardening, or any other endeavor, "Everything is the same until it's not. Either you can do a thing or don't yet know if you can. The question isn't 'Can I?' but 'How To?'"
page 141

This was an interesting chapter about what is effectively refereed to as mindfulness. There is a joke alone the line of 'mindfullness only has a place in society because of how poorly we do with attention'. The difference between the two may be that attention is often spoke as a singular focus(block out all else) and mindfulness is a more encompassing focus(pay attention to what's in and around).

What I found most interesting about this chapter is the negative relationship between form and creativity and fitting to a strucutre. It's not that structure hampers creativities, it is that structure can all the mind to go on autopilot and work without thinking. This is the last thing you need to keep your head in the creative space.
Look at situations as unique experiences. Try to understanding what someone or thing means rather then thinking about how it fits in line with something else (did they get the write answer or did that explain their idea)
You need to drop dependence on doing things the "right way" and allow your self to make them happen they way they do.


## Chapter 10 Focus Interrupts

s that the short interrupts dramatically slow your process because they require you back up and reassess where you were.

 > Accustomed to triaging your electronic contacts, you might also find yourself wondering if actually talking to someone just because she's your neighbor or he's your uncle miss the best use of your valuable time. The young in particular might fail to consider how many people in their electronic address book really know them and would be there for them if they needed help, as a friend or relative does and would.

Wow, this statement really hit home. Because we focus so much time on internet based medium we loss our ability and want to interact in a personal face to face mannor. I ride the bus into a college campus and this is the best summary of the interpersonal interactions that take place in that system.

> attention: "the ability to frame your field of awareness in the awy that will be most useful to the task at hand"
> Energy flows where attention goes
Amishi Jha  page 161

Often we think of attention as the focus on the sigular but it is important to realize that it can be a disfuss process that takes in much.

## Chapter 11: Disordered Attention
Chapter about ADHD primarily

An interesting note is that there is a strong correlation between childhood success in school and future well being. In that those who do not perform well in the classroom are likely to have a harder path ahead of them. This is likely due to the lack of learning how to be attentive in the formational years. This is the most important time for building the skills that will define us latter on.

> According to the "perceptual load" theory, you'll experience more distractions when your task is not very engaging
page 167

Simple but potent statement. If your not engaged by the feature or situation you in your more likely to be distracted.

> If you really want to focus on something, says Castellanos, the optimum amount of time to spend on it is ninety minutes. "Then change tasks. And watch out for interruptions once you're really concentrating, because it will take you twenty minutes to recover."
page 172

Directly ties back to the idea of deep work. Attention is something that needs to be actively protected, because those interruptions are very costly.

## chapter 12: Motivation: Eyes on the Prize

> We consume 35 percent more food when dining with a friend - and 50 percent more with a big group - than when alone.
page 174

I can tell this is real. A form of peer pressures of sort that get at the major theme of the chapter. There are many subconscious actions that effect how we make decision about our actions. Getting around this requires preplanning and attendance to before hand. Here is an idea I'm going to try.

- write out what you eat over the day.
- measure your weight frequently
- write out physical activates

This allows you to make proactive decision and understand what causes what.

There are three driving forces behind human motivations. Power, achievement, and affiliation. The effect of each is different for every person. It's important to take the time to understand which most strongly effects you and keep that in mind when trying to build your personal motivation.

> To be effective, praise, like criticism, should be precisely targeted: not "You're so great!" but "You did a great job on that report!"
page 177

This seems really significant and an easy thing to do to help a kid or any person grow. If feedback is direct we can understand the direct connection between action and feedback. If it's defuse individual begin to think of the quality of there work as inherent not due to specific action. What this action does is promote the application of effort as the feature to be rewarded. This is surmised as grit and has been shown to be more important that intellectual or social ability in define success.

> Nevertheless, says Duckworth, resaerch has made one thing very clear.: "Life is relatively short, so don't labor under the delusion that you can keep switching your focus from goal to goal and get anywhere."
page 181

This one stung a bit. I've been getting better at trying to follow a distinct line but it's never very clear what the actual goal is. Something to work on I guess.

By planning the reaction we will have to something we want to avoid we can give ourself an option when the temptation shows itself. Visual what you want to happen before you have to make the decision.

> Putting this motivational dynamic in mathematical terms, Ainslie says that we "spontaneously discount the value of expected events in a curve where value is divided approximately by expected delay."
Page 185

Basically the want to have something now overcome the valuing of the feature. We will take 100 dollars now rather then 200 in a year. However 100 in a month vs 200 in a year and people will start changing their minds a bit.

## Chapter 13: Health: Energy Goes Where Attention Flows

 > As Kabat-Zinn observes, "When you feel more comfortable in your own skin, lots of things, -- outlook, diet, exercise, relationship --- may also change, and all of them have profound effects on your health. When you drop in to your own experience and body, you get a sense of belonging, fitting in, coming to terms with things as they are: That's what healing is."
>page 196

Lot and lots of content in that statement. Specifically the "drop in to your own experience and body" to me is incredible important. That is a summary of being present in the here and now. If your in it and not thinking else where all the worries about external and internal expectations fade and life is better. Both mentally and physically.  Profoundly simple to say harder to do. Thought one needs to try.

> Kabat-Zinn "Meditation is less about the target than about a state of pure attention that occurs before thinking. A knowing that's more like intuition than cognition."
page 192

It's nice to heard these descriptions that don't confine the process of meditation or mindfullness. It allow the state to be something to reach for in all the actions. Pure presences of being in whatever your doing.

> "Zorba can dance in the present moment, because he knows that stress --- the full catastrophe -- is not good or bad, but just part of the way of life is. You're in it, so how can you best relate to what's happening, both for yourself and for any others involved? "
page 193

Showing judgement breaks you out of the present. The idea is that good or bad from the outside if you stay involved in what's happening you can build value from the experience. Find a place within don't infer about it from the outside.

## Chapter 14: Meaning: Attending to What Matters Most
This is a great concluding chapter to a great book!

> "At the same time, I think there's a reality beneath what we can see with our eyes and experience with our senses. There's ultimately something mysterious and unmaterialistic about the world. something large and awe-inspiring and eternal and unknowable."
Page 204 - Jonathan Franzen

Two initial thoughts on this. One that eternal mystical thing could emergent properties of systems!
Secondly this is basically a definition of spirituality. A notion that is independent but often associated with religion.

> Asked to define attention, Choegyal says, "It means mindfulness --- just the mind being simple. Whether in meditation or daily life, we try to pay attention to just being present, rather then being caught between hope and fear, which is the mind's usual condition."
page 206

Love it! Caught between hope and fear. Focus on what happened or what to come! It's a strange defination of attention because it implies that the work of future can not be attended too. Maybe that's taking it to far, still as a defining of mindfulness its gorgeous.

>Seen from this perspective, our customary focus on things temporal and material is the major cause of human misery, because it distracts us from attending to timeless, formless true reality.
page 209

Continued reinforcement of the idea that being present is the key to happiness. I wrote it done because it intones the idea that things and dreams are not going to make you happy. why do we work so hard for them.

> "It's virtually impossible to be happy with good relationships," says Peterson, "That comes out in the research again and again." it's often said that virtue is its own reward, but love and its corollary of kindness confer other major benefits on those who practice them. Whether or not the recipients gain, says Peterson, "we know that the does do! They're happier and healthier and live long than people who pursue all the latest toys but never have enough."
page 212

I'm being to see my own biases in my quote selection. Materialism will not make you happy. Community and relationships will. Particularly relationships that allow you to give.

> As Albert Einstein put it, "There are two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a mitacle. The other is as though everything is a miracle."
page 214

This is a  direct statement about the role of spirituality. Do you see the mystery in the world or is it something that is well understood.

> The point, says Bryant, is that " you see what you look for. And you can train yourself to attend to the joy out there waiting to be had, instead of passively waiting for it to come to you."  
page 216

We have the power to obtain the reality we want by focusing on life from the top down. Use our minds as tools for well being rather then let them be influence by those around us.

# Concluding
> If I tense up over a big decision, I remember the fortune-cookie rule: nothing is as important as I think it is when I'm focusing on it.
