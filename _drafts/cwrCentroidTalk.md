# CRAFT Science outline

Creative (How)
 - Standard talk, nothing too crazy. Allow ideas to come up and pursue them as they do.
 - make a word puzzle map at different resolution
  - three variables
  - two conditions
  -introduction activity  

Relevant (How)
  -  uncertainty in the role of science
  -  food as a resource

Audience (Who)
  - educated GIS users

Format (What)
  - power point presentation

Take home message (why)
  - As scientist we push the limits of what is possible to show that data can help show us a way forward, yet we need to understand that we're always be limited and it's up to us to deal with that fact in a constructive way.

## 7 primary story themes

1) Overcoming the Monster;
2) Rags to Riches;
3) The Quest;
4) Voyage and Return;
- I'm feeling this one. We take off on this big endeavor to get back to a simple and easily understood answer. Why do we need this process.

5) Comedy;
6) Tragedy; and
7) Rebirth.

## Frame Theory: how to frame your conflict

- social progress
Because this talk is standing out a bit beyond CWR and the details in the work I think this topic is work trying. As a scientist, I go on this journey of learning and data and come back and how to evaluate it's place in the greater good. How can this work mean more than data? How can we connect science to the ideals that guide or actions. This is really me trying to face my own questions but lets try it. I can always back pedal to the standard and leave this hard to answer questions out of it.

- economic development
- moral or ethical right

- scientific uncertainty

This is kinda the core of how I will tell the details of out methods. Balance uncertainties while staying within the realm of the theoretical framework the work is built upon.

- Pandora's box
- public accountability
- middle way
- conflict strategy


1. Set the message
 - define a clear and distinct **take home message**



 2. Set the frame of the story
- decide on one or two Frames from which you will describe your narrative. What emotional process are you trying to appeal to.

 3. Story theme
- The theme describe the progress of the narrative. Overcoming the monster is a common one in science because the problem can be set as the monster.  

4. Building emotional ties  
- events
  - What are the actions that take place, where are there, who is involved
- characters
  - What people are connected, is the feature your studying a character
- conflict/resolution
  -  try to tie this to a [Socio-Scientific Issues(SSI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socio-scientific_issues) because it's likely the audience has a perspective on it and therefore has
- causality/agency
  - How can the characters or the audience play a role in the process.

4. Checking back with CRAFT.
If we take a look at the process so far we've address quite a few of the aspects of CRAFT.

### Audience
Audience is a group ranging from professionals to students who are interested in GIS and probably know very little about CWRs. I know this from knowing the venue that I'm presenting at.
### Take home message
Take home message is loud and clear. There is a challenge and geospatial knowledge is needed.
### Format
This will be presentation but I'm building it around a story of a well know crop. I'm framing in around the SSI of genetic modification and suggesting a right and less dramatic alternative to the current process.

### Relevancy
This is really about the future of food and how folks in this audience can help. At the end I tie there skills to part of the solution.

### Creative
There is a lot of room for growth in this area but it's a start. As the presentation comes together I think there will be a lot of opportunity to make it something more creative. Specifically showing visualizations of the problem at hand.






Modern agriculture has transformed crops into amazingly productive products by promoting the qualities that maximize the yield of the consumable parts of the plant. By continuously selecting for yield, we have promoted a very rich and productive crop. Yet this has come at the cost of reducing the natural capital on which the plants are formed, their genetic diversity. While our very specialized plants work well in very specialized environments, the loss of their genetic diversity significantly reduces their ability to adapt to the changing world around them.

Luckily for us, modern crops have a "wealthy relative" who is ready and willing to help them through these hard times. We call these rich species, crop wild relatives. They are found throughout the world and are wealthy in the genetic diversity they store. While we know of the potential of crop wild relatives, we still need to understand where these species can be found and if it is possible to infer what type of genetic diversity specific populations might contain.

Work is being done at the USDA's National Laboratory for Genetic Resource Preservation to help answer these two spatial questions. This talk will highlight

1) Why you should care about Crop Wild Relatives
2) Our methods for understanding their spatial distribution.
3) How we're trying to make this work impactful outside of our own community.

The majority of time will be spent on walking through the development and application of a reproducible species distribution modeling process.  





Short version 
Crop wild relatives(CWR) are genetically diverse plants that are related to modern crops. Plant breeders can cross breed modern crops with their CWRs to incorporate beneficial traits present from CWR into our food species. Yet understanding where to find CWR populations and which populations will have the desired traits is an ongoing challenge. The USDA is addressing this challenge by developing a reproducible spatial model to identify the potential range of CWR species and exploring the connection between environmental conditions and genetic traits. This talk will explain why CWR are such an important resource and the complexities associated with applying geographic research to traditionally non spatial field such as plant genetics.
