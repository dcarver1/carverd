# Review of Deep Work by Cal Newport

This book is about the promotion of productivity by the focus of attention on single tasks for long periods of time. It pulls examples mostly from the business and academic world where professional success has some well define metrics. What is attractive to me about the work is that the ideas allign well with the more spiritual self help books I've been reading. Focus, attention, and direction line up in your experience of the world or within this books arguments the professional ambitions

### Introduction

> **The Deep Work Hypothesis:** The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.
Page 14

The introductory chapter highlights the primary connection of this book, deep work is essential to knowledge based jobs. If you need to produce complex ideas you need to be able to work deeply.

### Deep Work is Valuable

In a quick review of the a work that examines the changes taking place in our modern economy the author poses that their are certain skills that allow an indiviudal to be sucessful. I found it interesting that The effect of the increase connectivety of the modern economy allows individal people(node) to take more of the work. The result is that being at the top of game will be allow for more and more benifits, while it will become more difficult ot get there.

> *Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy*
1. The ability to quickly master hard things.
2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.
page 29

The extension of these two primary components are obvious. The increase connectivity of the economy allows for the more rapid diffusion of information and ideas. This means more change. One needs to be at the front of the change to remain successful. This requires learning and producing quickly.

>  To Learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely owithout distraction. To learn, in other words, is an act of deep work. If you're comfortable going deep, you'll be comfortable mastering the increasingly complex sytems and skills needed to thrive in our economy. If yo instead remain one of the many for whom depth is uncomfortable and distraction ubiquitous, you shound't expect these systems and skills to come easily to you.
page 37

This idea is backed by examination of research about how information is transferred within the brain. Use builds the connective structure. Focused use allows the more effective building of the structure.

> High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent)X(Intensity of Focus)
page 40

> To produce at your peak you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction. Put an other way, the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work.
page 44

This claim was justified by a very interesting study that looked at the residual effect of transferring between task, *attention residual*. The idea is that your focus on a topic lingers even after you've moved on from that topic. The result is that you can become distracted by those past attention residuals and it will effect your current performance.

### Deep Work is Rare

This chapter looks are the reason why deep work is not common place within the modern economy. Deep work is frankly a counter culture to the trends of the current workspace, multitasking, constant communication, and distractions.

*Metric Black Hole*
This is a core reason why deep work is challenging at the institutional level. How can one measure productivity. In some professions this is easier then others. Yet deep work does not produce many measurable metric on the day to day. It's a bigger picture, long term effect that simply can be measured as well as shallow work. If it can be measured it is harder to evaluate.

> **The Principle of Least Resistance**: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.
page 58

I my opinion this applies to all aspects of human decision making. It takes more effort and will to stay focused. Deep work is harder and something that needs to be trained. Because it's hard to measure it takes a lot of conviction to make it work. Going with the norm is easier.

>**Busyness as a Proxy for Productivity:** In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.  

This is felt in my work place as meetings start to pile up. You've got more things on the calendar but you find your doing less. The tricky aspect of this is that being present and building connections within your professional network does tend to lead to real benefits. Fall into the "winner must be present" idea. What is proposed here is that we've come to value that so much that we let it take over our ability to produce quality work.

*The Cult of the Internet*
this is really interesting look at technology and society. Specifically the fact that we no longer question the benefit that a new technology will have on our process it is just accepted as a step forward.

## Deep Work Is Meaningful
This chapter spends some time making that larger connection to the importance of focus and dedication overall well being. It reviews some research for a few different reasons why deep work impacts you life outside of the work place.

*A Neurological Argument for Depth*
This reviews the work of Winifred Gallaghers work in the book Rapt. I'm adding it to me to read list.
The core tenant is that our focus defines our mental state and overall well being.

> Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love - is the sum of what you focus on.
Gallagher page 77

A great message that we can not control our circumstances but we can control what we think about.

*A Psychological Argument for Depth*
Expands upon the work by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who is attributed with writing about the "flow state".
A core idea is that flow states are what makes us happy, it's easier to be happy with direction and purpose then it is when dealing with time off.

> Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one's work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.
Csikszentmihalyi page 84

*A Philosophical Argument for Depth*
Discusses the work of Hubert Dreyfus and Sean Dorrance Kelly regarding the role of the scared in our work. The general idea is that there has been a separation between objects meaning and our applied meaning to objects. Specific things do not have quality beyond what we apply to them. The result of that is we don't find the motivation or direction form the things we work with. It's a human centric personal view of the world that removes the special qualities of features. With out this sacredness we loss our sense of worth within the work.

# Part 2 : The Rules
### Work Deeply

The chapter starts with the idea that will power is a limited resource and claims that methods need to be taken to ensure deep work is accomplished in the generally not supportive work place environment. Four main philosophy are defined

**The monastic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling**
Basically an extreme. Held by people who do not need to interact with others to do their work. Sounds a bit like people who live to do their work. I can't see this being practical in my own life.

**The Bimodal Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling**
This scheduling is about setting aside large portions of time for deep work and large portions of time for the more day to day activity. I see thing as incorporating writing retreats to you schedule. Planned time away from communication. This seems valuable for specific projects. I like the idea of setting up out of office notices to ensure work gets done. This could be a harder on to explain to the boss.

**The Rhythmic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling**
This seems like the easiest to make happen. Setting a scheduled event that is all about deep work and doing it consistently. I've been trying this and I think it makes a lot of sense. The nice part about it is that the see the progress moving forward.

**The Journalistic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling**
This did not really seem like a schedule at all. Basically do what you can when you can. Ad Hoc. This is probably what most people will get pushed into but it takes away a lot of the message of this book. Deep work should be important enough that it can be scheduled. The author suggests avoid this technique while beginning. My personal adaptation of this is have two hours that happens each work day. If I can't make it at the set time I adjust the time.

**Ritualize**
With the work philosophy laid out it comes down to implementation. The goal here is to have a set of parameters that you can follow to make sure deep work happeneds. This will make sense to everyone becuase they are not really new.
- Where will you work (helpful if outside of normal workplace)
- how will you work (metric for productivity )
- How will you support your work ( comfort)

**Make Grand Gestures**
This builds off the idea that we value things that come with commitment more then those that we simply receive. The idea here is that is you need to make deep work happen, really comment and make it happen. This could mean putting yourself up in a hotel or using the out of office logic to make sure your open.
What ever it is, the bigger commentment you make too it hte more significant you will feel the time is.

**Don't Work Alone**
This seemed to be present to confront the growing theme that deep work requires isolation. While that still true the reality of it is that you dont need to only work alone. In small teams of with partners you can still practice this deep work stratigies.

**Execute Like A Business**
Based on the work of Clayton Christensen woh developed The 4 Disciplines of Execution. This series of step was put forth to help organization move from the what to the how. Ideas and stratigies are easy to generate but how do we make them happen
1. Focus on the Wildly Important
DEep work should be very focused, with set goals and targetable achievements. Be deliberate about what the most important priority is and let that define your work.
 2. Act on the Lead Measures
 Lead measures are essentailly the imediate results of an action. The goal is that deep work could be measure with, number of pages written or number of hours spent. Even thought the important goal is number of papers published. The lag time better effort and acheivment is to much to use as a motivator.
 3. Keep a Compelling Scoreboard
 If you have a measurable lead measure that builds to your wildly important goal , keep track of it. Keep it visible and use it as a motivator to keep up the work
 4. Create a Cadence of Accountability
 Establish reoccurring meetings that are used to evaluate the progress and attempt to understand why this week was better then the last.

 **Be Lazy**
I was not expecting it but I got a lot out of this section. It all centers around the idea of strengthing the work/life divide. Finding ways to be do with work when you leave work will acutally help you work more effectively. I love the implications of this. Three reason for this logic were provided.

1. *Downtime Aids Insights*
This looks at the work by a psychologist Ap Dijksterhuis on the role of conscious and unconscious thought on decision making. The take away is that decision based on very strict and well defined rules are best made by the conscious mind(actively thinking about the problem). For example determining what time you would need to leave to make it to the airport. On the other hand problems that are complex and require a lot variables and vague parameters are better left to the unconcious mind. That is, go with the gut.
*word of skepticism*  It was not clear why decisions were deemed better. I think you look back on unconscious decisions with less criticism because you often don't rely on the pro con strategies of conscious effects. You just made the choice and went with it. When you mull things over your those counter arguments to your decisions are more likely to come back up.
That said, I think for the most part, allow the unconscious mind to feel through a process is a great alternative to the stress of having to make a decision.

2. *Downtime Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work Deeply*
This is based on the idea that direct attention is a resource with a limit. Taking breaks in environmental that promote a soft focus, they are engaging but don't require much active decision making, such as walking in a natural environment allow the stores of direct attention to rebuild. This allows for more effective deep work.

3. *The Work That Evening Downtime Replaces Is Usually Not That Important*
This idea pulls on the "Deliberate Practice Theory" by Andres Ericsson. This is a study that has come up many times in the past. The idea is that professionals can only maintain a state of deliberate practice, which is cognitively comparable to deep work, for on average 3.5 hours. This number was significantly less for amateurs. Knowing that you can reach your maximum effect work within a given workday it is very likely that evening work will be shallow and not contribute much. In fact the evening work will detract from the first two aspects and results in less ability to perform deep work the following day.

**Shut Down Ritual**
This is interesting and something I want to implement.
The goal is close out all your current tasks, develop a plan for how to address them in the future, and a verbal conformation of the end of the day.
The logic is two fold. First that by review your task you understand where things are and nothing unexpectedly pops up in your mind later that evening. Secondly, by identifying the next steps needed with a task we can more readily set it down because we know when and what to pick back up.

I'm going to try this, here are my initial steps that I will take. These may change.
1. Check Email
  - respond where possible
  - add other content to task lists
2. Check daily task lists
  - review the dailys tasks
  - define next steps for active features
  - place two important items in deep and essential calendar event for tomorrow
3. Optional: Add to daily page to break the work mindset.
4. Say "Shuting down" and turn off the pc

We'll see how it goes.
