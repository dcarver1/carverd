# Review of Deep Work by Cal Newport

This book is about the promotion of productivity by the focus of attention on single tasks for long periods of time. It pulls examples mostly from the business and academic world where professional success has some well define metrics. What is attractive to me about the work is that the ideas align well with the more spiritual self help books I've been reading. Focus, attention, and direction line up in your experience of the world or within this books arguments the professional ambitions

### Introduction

> **The Deep Work Hypothesis:** The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.
Page 14

The introductory chapter highlights the primary connection of this book, deep work is essential to knowledge based jobs. If you need to produce complex ideas you need to be able to work deeply.

### Deep Work is Valuable

In a quick review of the a work that examines the changes taking place in our modern economy the author poses that their are certain skills that allow an individual to be successful. I found it interesting that The effect of the increase connectivity of the modern economy allows individual people(node) to take more of the work. The result is that being at the top of game will be allow for more and more benefits, while it will become more difficult to get there.

> *Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy*
1. The ability to quickly master hard things.
2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.
page 29

The extension of these two primary components are obvious. The increase connectivity of the economy allows for the more rapid diffusion of information and ideas. This means more change. One needs to be at the front of the change to remain successful. This requires learning and producing quickly.

>  To Learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction. To learn, in other words, is an act of deep work. If you're comfortable going deep, you'll be comfortable mastering the increasingly complex systems and skills needed to thrive in our economy. If yo instead remain one of the many for whom depth is uncomfortable and distraction ubiquitous, you shouldn't expect these systems and skills to come easily to you.
page 37

This idea is backed by examination of research about how information is transferred within the brain. Use builds the connective structure. Focused use allows the more effective building of the structure.

> High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent)X(Intensity of Focus)
page 40

> To produce at your peak you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction. Put an other way, the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work.
page 44

This claim was justified by a very interesting study that looked at the residual effect of transferring between task, *attention residual*. The idea is that your focus on a topic lingers even after you've moved on from that topic. The result is that you can become distracted by those past attention residuals and it will effect your current performance.

### Deep Work is Rare

This chapter looks are the reason why deep work is not common place within the modern economy. Deep work is frankly a counter culture to the trends of the current workspace, multitasking, constant communication, and distractions.

*Metric Black Hole*
This is a core reason why deep work is challenging at the institutional level. How can one measure productivity. In some professions this is easier then others. Yet deep work does not produce many measurable metric on the day to day. It's a bigger picture, long term effect that simply can be measured as well as shallow work. If it can be measured it is harder to evaluate.

> **The Principle of Least Resistance**: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.
page 58

I my opinion this applies to all aspects of human decision making. It takes more effort and will to stay focused. Deep work is harder and something that needs to be trained. Because it's hard to measure it takes a lot of conviction to make it work. Going with the norm is easier.

>**Busyness as a Proxy for Productivity:** In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.  

This is felt in my work place as meetings start to pile up. You've got more things on the calendar but you find your doing less. The tricky aspect of this is that being present and building connections within your professional network does tend to lead to real benefits. Fall into the "winner must be present" idea. What is proposed here is that we've come to value that so much that we let it take over our ability to produce quality work.

*The Cult of the Internet*
this is really interesting look at technology and society. Specifically the fact that we no longer question the benefit that a new technology will have on our process it is just accepted as a step forward.

## Deep Work Is Meaningful
This chapter spends some time making that larger connection to the importance of focus and dedication overall well being. It reviews some research for a few different reasons why deep work impacts you life outside of the work place.

*A Neurological Argument for Depth*
This reviews the work of Winifred Gallaghers work in the book Rapt. I'm adding it to me to read list.
The core tenant is that our focus defines our mental state and overall well being.

> Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love - is the sum of what you focus on.
Gallagher page 77

A great message that we can not control our circumstances but we can control what we think about.

*A Psychological Argument for Depth*
Expands upon the work by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who is attributed with writing about the "flow state".
A core idea is that flow states are what makes us happy, it's easier to be happy with direction and purpose then it is when dealing with time off.

> Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one's work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.
Csikszentmihalyi page 84

*A Philosophical Argument for Depth*
Discusses the work of Hubert Dreyfus and Sean Dorrance Kelly regarding the role of the scared in our work. The general idea is that there has been a separation between objects meaning and our applied meaning to objects. Specific things do not have quality beyond what we apply to them. The result of that is we don't find the motivation or direction form the things we work with. It's a human centric personal view of the world that removes the special qualities of features. With out this sacredness we loss our sense of worth within the work.

# Part 2 : The Rules
### Work Deeply

The chapter starts with the idea that will power is a limited resource and claims that methods need to be taken to ensure deep work is accomplished in the generally not supportive work place environment. Four main philosophy are defined

**The monastic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling**
Basically an extreme. Held by people who do not need to interact with others to do their work. Sounds a bit like people who live to do their work. I can't see this being practical in my own life.

**The Bimodal Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling**
This scheduling is about setting aside large portions of time for deep work and large portions of time for the more day to day activity. I see thing as incorporating writing retreats to you schedule. Planned time away from communication. This seems valuable for specific projects. I like the idea of setting up out of office notices to ensure work gets done. This could be a harder on to explain to the boss.

**The Rhythmic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling**
This seems like the easiest to make happen. Setting a scheduled event that is all about deep work and doing it consistently. I've been trying this and I think it makes a lot of sense. The nice part about it is that the see the progress moving forward.

**The Journalistic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling**
This did not really seem like a schedule at all. Basically do what you can when you can. Ad Hoc. This is probably what most people will get pushed into but it takes away a lot of the message of this book. Deep work should be important enough that it can be scheduled. The author suggests avoid this technique while beginning. My personal adaptation of this is have two hours that happens each work day. If I can't make it at the set time I adjust the time.

**Ritualize**
With the work philosophy laid out it comes down to implementation. The goal here is to have a set of parameters that you can follow to make sure deep work happens. This will make sense to everyone because they are not really new.
- Where will you work (helpful if outside of normal workplace)
- how will you work (metric for productivity )
- How will you support your work ( comfort)

**Make Grand Gestures**
This builds off the idea that we value things that come with commitment more then those that we simply receive. The idea here is that is you need to make deep work happen, really comment and make it happen. This could mean putting yourself up in a hotel or using the out of office logic to make sure your open.
What ever it is, the bigger commitment you make too it the more significant you will feel the time is.

**Don't Work Alone**
This seemed to be present to confront the growing theme that deep work requires isolation. While that still true the reality of it is that you don't need to only work alone. In small teams of with partners you can still practice this deep work strategies.

**Execute Like A Business**
Based on the work of Clayton Christensen who developed The 4 Disciplines of Execution. This series of step was put forth to help organization move from the what to the how. Ideas and strategies are easy to generate but how do we make them happen
1. Focus on the Wildly Important
Deep work should be very focused, with set goals and targetable achievements. Be deliberate about what the most important priority is and let that define your work.
 2. Act on the Lead Measures
 Lead measures are essentially the immediate results of an action. The goal is that deep work could be measure with, number of pages written or number of hours spent. Even thought the important goal is number of papers published. The lag time better effort and achievement is to much to use as a motivator.
 3. Keep a Compelling Scoreboard
 If you have a measurable lead measure that builds to your wildly important goal , keep track of it. Keep it visible and use it as a motivator to keep up the work
 4. Create a Cadence of Accountability
 Establish reoccurring meetings that are used to evaluate the progress and attempt to understand why this week was better then the last.

 **Be Lazy**
I was not expecting it but I got a lot out of this section. It all centers around the idea of strengthen the work/life divide. Finding ways to be do with work when you leave work will actually help you work more effectively. I love the implications of this. Three reason for this logic were provided.

1. *Downtime Aids Insights*
This looks at the work by a psychologist Ap Dijksterhuis on the role of conscious and unconscious thought on decision making. The take away is that decision based on very strict and well defined rules are best made by the conscious mind(actively thinking about the problem). For example determining what time you would need to leave to make it to the airport. On the other hand problems that are complex and require a lot variables and vague parameters are better left to the unconscious mind. That is, go with the gut.
*word of skepticism*  It was not clear why decisions were deemed better. I think you look back on unconscious decisions with less criticism because you often don't rely on the pro con strategies of conscious effects. You just made the choice and went with it. When you mull things over your those counter arguments to your decisions are more likely to come back up.
That said, I think for the most part, allow the unconscious mind to feel through a process is a great alternative to the stress of having to make a decision.

2. *Downtime Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work Deeply*
This is based on the idea that direct attention is a resource with a limit. Taking breaks in environmental that promote a soft focus, they are engaging but don't require much active decision making, such as walking in a natural environment allow the stores of direct attention to rebuild. This allows for more effective deep work.

3. *The Work That Evening Downtime Replaces Is Usually Not That Important*
This idea pulls on the "Deliberate Practice Theory" by Andres Ericsson. This is a study that has come up many times in the past. The idea is that professionals can only maintain a state of deliberate practice, which is cognitively comparable to deep work, for on average 3.5 hours. This number was significantly less for amateurs. Knowing that you can reach your maximum effect work within a given workday it is very likely that evening work will be shallow and not contribute much. In fact the evening work will detract from the first two aspects and results in less ability to perform deep work the following day.

**Shut Down Ritual**
This is interesting and something I want to implement.
The goal is close out all your current tasks, develop a plan for how to address them in the future, and a verbal conformation of the end of the day.
The logic is two fold. First that by review your task you understand where things are and nothing unexpectedly pops up in your mind later that evening. Secondly, by identifying the next steps needed with a task we can more readily set it down because we know when and what to pick back up.

I'm going to try this, here are my initial steps that I will take. These may change.
1. Check Email
  - respond where possible
  - add other content to task lists
2. Check daily task lists
  - review the daily tasks
  - define next steps for active features
  - place two important items in deep and essential calendar event for tomorrow
3. Optional: Add to daily page to break the work mindset.
4. Say "Shuting down" and turn off the pc

We'll see how it goes.

### Embrace Boredom
Much like any other skill set the ability to sustain focus is something that falls into the use it or lose it category. The danger of this is currently many people are in state of needing constant stimuli. Standing in like at the grocery store, we pull out our phone to push things around rather then just stand. Deep work require directed focus on potential features of low stimuli. As we practice the act of being ok with low stimuli environments we are supporting our ability to stay focused within them.
Some very strong conclusions about the effect of a constantly stimulating environment from the work from Clifford Nass is cited. The short of it is that those who live in a state of constant distraction are re working the ability of their brain to stay focused. Kinda a scary thought.

**Don't Take Breaks from Distraction Instead Take Breaks from Focus.**
 Most people use distractions as a reward. Once I get this done I'll watch that video I was told about. In that sense you are schedule, though many not on a calendar, your focus time to make time for the distraction. In many way seems out of whack with where would be place our personal priorities. Yet it will take a very active effort to flip this.
Ideas such as internet Sabbath( a day a week without internet) are methods to star but it's probably impossible to form a strong habit only practicing one day out of seven. The authors suggestion is that you start scheduling internet time. Set aside period where you will not use the internet. If you require internet often, best to make shorty blocks. This is a training of sorts to resist the temptation of distraction.
The author provide three specific pointers.

1. *This strategy works even if your job requires lots of Internet use and/or prompt e-mail replies.*
Just schedule the internet free periods in shorter segments. If you can get your replies out quick in 10 minutes, schedule 20 minute non internet time still means your not distracted for two thirds of the day.

2. *Regardless of how you schedule your internet blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet use.*
No cheating. The point of all this is not sure much that internet is a bad tool but developing the resolve to live with it because it is distracting. If you comment to no internet stand by it.

3. *Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can further improve your concentration training.*
I think this gets back to the idea that a habit is best formed by practicing it every day. The book hints to the effect of deep work in your everyday life. This is a natural extension.  


**Work Like Teddy Roosevelt**
I think this is the ultimate goal in the long run. Be able to focus intensely on the things that need to get done so you can spend time enjoying other pursuits. Roosevelt was a big time schedule person and certainly a follow of the focus on the critically important rule. The author suggest practicing intensity by pushing yourself to complete a given task in a short amount of time then is generally needed. This seems a little much at the moment but might have a place.

**Meditate Productively**
Finally a section in a book about meditation that does not make me feel like I will forever be unsuccessful at it. The goal is the same, focus on a single feature. Let other thoughts come up but don't let them take over. In this book the idea of productive meditation is finding an opportunity to incorporate movement or travel on foot to provide space and time to just simple think about a problem.
To me the movement helps stay focused. The author did provide two suggestions for helping stay on tract in the meditative sessions.
1. *Be Wary of Distractions and Looping*
- nothing new from the distraction idea but looping was interesting. You mind will want to stray away from cognitively challenging task. One mechanism it employs to do so is to loop back over simple information that has already been determine. Much like the distractions, it's all about recognizing your in it and trying to push it way from your attention.

2. *Structure your Deep Thinking*
It helps to coming to one of these meditative session with a plan. This is the idea I have a how do I make a story out of it. This structure helps keep your mind centered and makes it easier to move away from distractions and looping.

**Memorize a Deck of Cards**
For me this was one of the weakest sections of the book so far. Basically memorization is an applied focus activity. Practicing memorization of random occurrences helps you practice focus. The deck of cards is just an example but basically it's a call to use memorization as a focus training tool.

### Quit Social Media
This is a rather strong argument against network tools such as facebook/linked in and other online features that tie you to a specific community (reddit, business insider). Similiar to many other of the messages within the book, the idea is that these resources produce shallow relationships which don't add up to a lot. The logic is structured around two primary elements.

> **the Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection:** You're justified in using a network tool if you can identify any possible benefit to its use, or anything you might possibly miss out on if you don't use it.
page 186

> **The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection:** Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your profession and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.
page 191

What this really seems to come down to is being intentional in your decision making about using a tool. This is difficult because it is easy to feel the pressure to engage in something when you hear the success story. The fear of missing out is a real thing that most people are strongly motivated by. Because of this we are far more likely to not take the time to access if this feature is really adding value you life or not. The authors claim is that we really take the time to answer that questions before deciding to engage with a network tool.

 **Apply the Law of the Vital Few to Your Internet Habits**
 Sticking with the theme of intentionality it is also important to know that generally speaking about 20% of the things we do contribute to 80% of outcome. This is taken directly from network analysis so learning to much on the specific numbers is not the main point. They will likely fall about in non network based systems. Regardless, the idea is that you do a few very very important things. Those should be the things that drive your decisions. Here is the advice.

 Define your professional Goal and the key activities that support that goal
 *Professional Goal:* Actively collaborate with domain professionals to apply geospatial analysis to their areas of interest.
 *Key Activities Support This Goal:*
 - maintain highly understanding of the application and interpretation of spatial data
 - Be able to convince others outside your area that your work is important to them

You can do this for your personal life goals as well.
At the end you have to ask yourself do these networking tools support the key activities that define my personal goals. If the answer is not a a sounding yes, then don't do it. This seems tough but if the goals and key activities are well defined there should not be that many tasks that directly support them.

**Quit Social Media**
The chapter defines some reasons to quit social media. The author suggest quitting for thirty days and then asking yourself.

> 1. Would the last thirty days have been notably better if I had been able to use this service?
> 2. Did people care that I wasn't using this service?
page 205

The reality will depend on your personal lifestyle I imagine but do so allows you really justify your actions moving forward.

Possible my favorite quote from the book so far.
> These services aren't necessarily, as advertised, the lifeblood of our modern connected world. They're just products, developed by private companies, funded lavishly, marketed carefully, and designed ultimately to capture then sell your personal information and attention to advertisers. They can be fun, but in the scheme of your life and what you want to accomplish, they're a lightweight  whimsy, one unimportant distraction among many threatening to derail you from something deeper.

 **Don't use the internet to Entertain Yourself**
 This whole section is basically an argument to value all the time you have. Don't reduce yourself to mindless distraction during your leisure hours. Find something that is meaningful to engage your mind. The idea is that we feel better when we've done something as value. Things of value should not only occur in the work place.


### Drain the Shallows
I found this section to have many useful tips on the best practices for make sure you can focus on deep work. It starts with a story to illustrate that with knowledge work, more hours does not really imply more work. This is the idea that makes me want to engage with this process most.

**Schedule Every Minute of Your Day**
In general folks are not very good at estimating how much time they spend with a give activity. If it is something that is culturally rewarded we end overestimating the time spent. If it is something that has little perceived cultural benefit we end up underestimating. What this all comes down to is we don't often have a clear idea about how we are spending out time. The suggestion.
write out you schedule for every day.
I was thrown off by this when I first read it but I'm going to give it a shot. The premise is that the schedule helps you stay intentional with your time.
Write out blocks of time with a specific task. If the length or timing of these blocks change go back to your schedule and readjust it to make sure that the new schedule reflects actual work. Your schedule will change everyday, but that fine, is the evaluation that is important. Overtime you should get better at understanding how long specific task take and understand when most of your days interruptions occur.

**Quantify the Depth of Every Activity**
The goal here is to develop the practice of not just saying no or yes to a process but really evaluating the worth of the activity before committing. This could be a commitment of time, a ranking of importance, or a assigning of value. The question that should be asked of the potential commitment is.
> How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?
page 229

This question is nice because it makes you assess your our expertise. If it is a ighly specialized task, that is likely why your were hired, you have that working knowledge that is hard to replicate. Tasks that can quickly be learned should not be viewed as more important then those that can't.

**Ask Your Boss for Shallow Work Budget**
This would be a challenging but productive conversation. The core feature to fall on is that shallow work can be easily trained, so it doesn't make much sense to pay a specialist to do that work at a higher pay grade. It is very unlikely that you get out form doing shallow work all together. The goal is that you can have the understand of your boss when you start turning down meeting requests or other administrative tasks.

**Finish Your Work by Five Thirty**
This section was really interesting. It's all about the idea of fixed schedule productivity. This goes against the conventional wisdom that working more means doing more. this is accomplished by understanding the hard limit on your time and prioritizing what efforts are most important.
This seems like a challenging system to get into but really the end goal that I want in my work place. Clarity of purpose and flexibility to decide how to make that happen. The set number of working hours is the best way to get yourself to start valuing your own time.

**Become Hard to Reach**
I found this kinda of a weak idea to end the book on but it is probably very relevant to most people. How to get away from unrelenting emails.
The tips are there but don't really add much to what has already been illustrated within the book. Be attentional and focused about what you spend your time with.

### conclusion
This is a bit of a recap of the role deep work has played in the authors own life. It is also the first time in the book I remember him mentioning anything about balance of productivity, in that his super productive year was probably too much.

### my conclusion
This is an excellent book for a very specific type of worker. The knowledge worker, as it is called, is someone who creates valuable products based on a learned experience or understanding. If your looking into reading this book it is worth asking, does your work align with that of a professional researcher in some form or another. For example, if you work is primarily interactions with people the ideas presented in this book will be hard to apply. My current work fits very will with a that of the knowledge worker and I found the content presented to be great.

The core idea is that focused work is more productive and valuable. You should be doing everything you can to support the ability to conducted focused work. This is called deep work throughout the book. There are many great examples and tips to how to make this happen. For example, prioritizing your activities by accessing how many months would it take to train a recent college graduate to complete this task. Focus your time and effect on the task that would require the most training. Those are the tasks that are best suited to your unique knowledge base.
One thing I wish was better explained was the progression of the steps. There area many aspects that lead to supporting Deep Work and implementing all of them at once would be a real challenge. I know the exact progression will differ from person to person, yet there seem like some of these ideas area easier to implement then others. For me this was obvious because I'm still early in my career as a knowledge worker so I need to spend more time developing a network then an established professional would.

I wrote extensive notes on this book, about 5000 words for a 70,000 word book. To me this means that there is a lot of valuable content within the text. Due to my work place environment, I can actively implement many of these strategies right away. I will be, because I feely believe that focus attention on a few very important ideas is the best way to move yourself forward.

I've already recommended this book to multiple individuals who are working in the research science field. The content promotes a alternative to the hyper connected workplace which makes a lot of sense to me. I'm not going to implement the strategies word for word but I am work to put my adaptation of them in place.
