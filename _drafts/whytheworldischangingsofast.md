Social change is a complex feature, so not only are there many inputs, the relationships between those inputs affect the result.
Yet after reading John Maeda's 2019 book How to Speak Machine, I found myself in agreement with his sentiment that understanding how computational systems work is essential in understanding the growth and development of our modern society. Computational systems matter because we are in a data-driven culture, and the majority of that data is gathered, interpreted, and conveyed via these systems.

As I work with computational systems, I knew that it is challenging to convey messages about iterative processes, the scale of analysis, and the magic of reproducible workflows. Most project partners are interested in the ends, not so much the means, and rightly so. Not everyone can be an analyst. Yet, my work is very narrow and very small compared to the information being collected and interpreted from every networked device, every web page, and countless other sources around the world. The use of this information varies, but those who use the computer and phone, this data helps provide extra convenience when using a device. Where people click helps designer improve  user interfaces but more importantly all this data allows for the grouping of content based on past choice of yourself and others. Making these association means that the end users will connect to content they are more likely to be interested in, and therefore will have a more enjoyable experience.  

When I search for a recipe on my web browser, I get food blogs primarily. If I look for the same content on my mother's web browsers, I primarily get Betty Crocker advertisements and hits for allrecipies. The input information ins the same the result is not. In a sense, none of us see the same world when we look into our screens. We see something similar to our peers but something wildly different from those who are different from us. This customization of user experience for billions of people is absolutely remarkable and also very rarely understood. To summarize the extent to which most users conceptualize this process, think of this last time you heard someone complain about "the damn algorithm" tossing a song they dont like into the que.

What all this customization means is a big important question. Our thought are greatly influenced by the information and stories that we hear. Thinks obviously get a little strange when you only every see one side of an issue. Given the scope of those questions, for now I'm a bit more concerned with how we got to this point. An obvious contributing factor is the rate of hardware development over time. Maeda beautifully describes this rate of change through an analogy that I found particularly noteworthy. Please take a look at his text chapter 5

La Jamais Contente was the first vehicle to travel over 100 kph. It did so using two 124 amp-hour electric motors that produced a total of 68 horsepower. It was 1899, and the world land speed record was set.

The current land speed record is 1,220 kph and set in 2017. If we assume a linear rate of change, the land speed record has increased by 11.4 kph per year.  
If the land speed record were to develop at the same rate as the microchip technology (a primary driver in the growth of in early computational systems), the La Jamais Contente would have broken the speed of light by 1924. From 100 kph to 1,079,000,000 kph in 24 years.

Everyone would have noticed this development, and people would very likely have something about it. They would actively try to understand how that growth was possible and how that rapid change would affect their culture's overall structures.

Yet that level of growth is exactly what has been happening in the world of technology for 40 plus years. Microchip processing power is no longer developing at an exponential rate, but new factors such as distributed computing, the ease of use of software, and the emergence of dense online-based social networks contribute to the historically remarkable rates of changes.

None of this change is inherently wrong. What I find concerning is that it's unclear how many people have any level of understanding of the scale at which computational systems exist behind the scenes. How much quantifiable data and code written by individuals are shaping what you see and experience in life. I believe that if an individual takes the time to understand computational systems, they are better prepared to choose to see beyond their bubble. To see more clearly, the complexity and commonalities present in all life.
