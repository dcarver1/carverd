# Land Cover Maps
When it comes down to it, I find land cover maps to be one of the most intriguing maps. This is in part from the respect to the process that goes into the development of those products but also just the information they hold.
Come fall I always pull up the National Land Cover Dataset and see if I can find a good aspen patch to go exploring in. Theses maps are generally used for very pratical purposes in research and planning so the goal is to make all the classes visually distinct. The result of this is a rather abstracted landscape that does not really look much like the real world. A usefully map, but not the most engaging.

Here's my theory with land cover. If you live in and explore the landscape around you, you know what the land cover actually looks like. So if the map looks like the landscape does, the user will be able to use the map to identify various land cover one the landscape.

To produce this map I realied heavily on the details outline by the contributers of [shaded relief](http://www.shadedrelief.com/)  The process relys heavily on photoshop and is a great practice to undertake if you are generally producing maps using more common spatial programs. A stretch activity of sorts. If your interested in producing one of these but sure to give yourself some time and be sure to have a good reason. Style takes time.
