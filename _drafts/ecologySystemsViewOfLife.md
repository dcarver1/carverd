I've been slowly reading though the Systems View of Life by Fritjof Capra and Pier Luigi Luisi over the couse of two years. I've loved the content and it's not really clear why I've been going though it so slowly. Still, it has been good to feel the perspectives within the book develop with me over the years. The most recent chapter I have read is about Ecology. I found it specifically relevant so I've taken the time to make a review of it here.

# The ecological dimension of life

Much of the content in this chapter is build around the Gaia theory, as it effectively view the planet as a fully self regulating organism. This perspective take the systems view of life to it's maximum extent within this planet.

> Indeed, according to Gaia theory, the evolution of the first living organisms went hand in hand with the transformation of the planetary surface from an inorganic environment to the self-regulating biosphere. "In that sense", writes Morowitz(1992, p.6) "life is a property of planets rather then of individual organisms."
p. 341

By bring the role of life back to the emergent property of the planet, it becomes unreasonable to talk about life in isolation.

## Development of basic ecological concepts

> This idea led not only to the concepts of food chains and food cycles, later to be expanded to the contemporary concept of food webs, but, eventually, also to the momentous recognition of the network as the basic pattern of organization of all living systems.
page 342

Ecology is a relatively young science, but it is inherently tied to the idea of interconnectedness and interdependence. The result of this is that it supports the role and importance of interactions between elements as necessary aspects in understanding the function of any systems. While it can be obvious that networks work in ecology, the power of this statement is that networks hold the ability to describe any self organizing system. They are foundational to the systems view of life.

> A basic principle of ecology is the recognition that ecosystems, like all living systems, form multilevel structures of systems nesting within other systems.
page 344

Networks can be apply to systems across various scales of space and time. The challenge in working with ecosystems then becomes the defining and distinguishing on what is part of the specific structure of interest. How can you limit the level of interaction.


## Are Ecosystems autopoietic?

I'll be honest, I'm still struggling with the concept of autopoietic, this is one of the more distinct definitions I have found in the text so far.

> The defining feature of an autopoietic system is that it continually recreates itself within a boundary of its own making. In a cell, for example, the membrane surrounding the cell is continually regenerated and maintained by internal cellular processes, and it contributes to theses processes, in turn, by regulating the flow of nutrients from the cell's environment.
page 348

Within ecology it is not well define if ecosystems are indeed autopoietic, that is they have the ability to regulate themselves with limited intersection from outside influences. Self regulation is essential for sustainability. I wish I had a better mechanism for describing the significance of this distinction. Probably need to reread the chapter to get at it. Regradless, what is clear is that because ecosystems have sure a high level of nested structures, they become incredible difficult to constrain.  

## Defining sustainability

There is a lot of disagreement over attempts to define sustainability. The agruement taken here is that we need not create our own defination but pull it from the qualities of life on this planet. A system which has been sustaining itself for over 3 billions years.

> Sustainable communities evolve their patterns of living over time in continual interaction with other living systems, both human and nonhuman. Hence, sustainability does not mean that things do not change. It is a dynamic process of coevolution rather than static state.
page 353

Not about setting a status que but allowing for fluctation around a norm. This is a much more challenging idea for people to work with, because suptial changes over time are hard to track.

## Ecological literacy
This is an awesome section, really hitting at the power and important of education and understanding. Good content about the difference between strictly ecological systems and social systems.

> The systems view of life discussed in this book provides an appropriate framework for the conceptual link between ecological and human communities. Both are living systems exhibiting common principles of organization. They are networks that are operationally closed but open to continual flows of energy and resources; they are self-organizing, operate far from equilibrium, and evolve by means of their inherent creativity, resulting in the emergence of new structures and new forms of order.
page 353

 I found this statment to be a great summary of the overall theme of the systems view of life. Defining what makes a living system unique and identifying what makes them so important. The emergence of new structures and forms of order.

 > The way to sustain life is to build and nurture community. A sustainable human community interacts with other communities - human and nonhuman - in ways that enable them to live and develop according to their nature.
 page 355

 This really gets at the beauty of this whole framework. Systems support and rely on the other systems which they interact with. Growth is positive when it supports those relationships and connections.

 ## Education for sustainable living

 > We need to teach our children, our students, and our coporate and political leaders, the fundamental facts of life - that one species' waste is another species' food; that matter cycles continually through the web of life; that the energy dribving the ecological cycles flows from the sun; that diversity assures resilience; that life, from its beginning more than 3 billion years ago; did not take over the planet by combat but by networking.
 page 356

 This brings a lot of meaning and significance to the understanding of ecology. It shows us how to live on this planet. If we buy into the concept that life is an emergent property of a planet not an individual, the ecology can teach us what we need to do to be a supportive and contributing part of that cycle. This is all very far removed from the standard thoughts regarding how to live, but I love it. It's grounded and beautiful and right in front of us. Learn from the living systems around us and work to support others.

 This section includes some details about a method for teaching the principles of ecology to grade school aged students.

 > The core of this framework consists of six "principles of ecology" - that is, six basic ecological concepts that represent a convenient summary of the principles of organization of all living systems.
 page 358

 The six principles are
- Networks: the defining structures of living and self organizing systems

- flows: all living systems balance the movement of energy and matter through themselves

- cycles: Feedback loops are an inherent and necessary part of living system. All elements has a place and that can change over time.

- nested systems : there is a depth of interactions among living systems. Elements of the flows and cycles are connected with various other networks across multiple scales of interaction.

- dynamic balance : How equilibrium within a system is meet is a constantly fluctuating series of parameters. Because living systems do not function on linear scales, the effect of specific actions has varying consequences based on the overall position of the equilibrium of the system.

- development : living systems have emergent properties that change the structure and function and the system. This develop is not directed by does generally result in the increased stability or diversity of the system as a whole. This is because of the autopoietic nature of living system.

I found this to be one of the more approachable and digestible chapters of the book so far.
