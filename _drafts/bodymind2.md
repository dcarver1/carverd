# Notes on Body Mind Mastery

## Chapter 1: Understanding the Larger Game
This frames out the connection between training and all aspects of life.
It is nice because while this is written specifically for athletes it is easy to connect to a personal and professional level right from the start.

four main ideas to focus
1. Non Resistance
four ways to approach forces of life
- surrender to them
- ignore them
- resist them
- use them to blend
The last of these is what is suggested. most of this centers around the idea of working with what you have. Making the most of a situation or idea

2. Accommodation
description of the learning processed
- development follows demand
- demand takes the form of progressive overload
- same movements outside of your comfort zone
- constant stream of little failures
- tolerance of the learning process
This is a good way to think of all processes. Match this with what fits into your way of being following the non resistance ideal

3. balance
Might the most difficult on to get right because it requires so much adaptation
Three things to balance
- physical
- emotional
- mental
The importance of each of these is that they flow up and down. Practice acceptance and be will to move with your bodies own needs and cycles

4.  Natural Order
Interesting idea that limits the importance of goal
> We can foresee the *direction* of our progress, but we can not foresee the *pace*

- focus on the process
- do not dwell on what could have been
- understand the rate of development and change
It's a hard one to summarize but the idea is that you do not need to focus on the thing that are outside of your control or reach. Stay focus on what your training is currently pushing you too.

## Chapter 2: The power of Awareness
I did write any notes about this not sure why.

## Chapter 3: Preparation
Nothing to groundbreaking in this section.
Really hitting on the point to focus on the basic skills and slowly build from that.
I feel like that is pretty reasonable think for coding, writing, disc golf even (low disc counts).

## Chapter 4: Mental Talent
What is nice about this book is that it really pushes the relationship between mental, physical, and emotional strength in creating well being. Still focused at sports but it's clear this is a very educated and good very of the role of sports in life. Somewhat obviously, the mental games is what makes or breaks success once the skill sets have been developed.

- limited Self-Concept
We place our own bounds on what we can or can not to all the time. These expectations are inherently what we end up living up to. This gets at the idea of self assessment. Interestingly the author success that we work on limiting the use of self-concept as much as possible. just focus on doing the task not trying to match a standard at all. I think that is good for general focus and being in the moment.

- Fear of Failure
I know this one very well. We worry about being wrong and making mistakes. While playing it safe has an advantage it generally does not all one to grow because it keep you inside your comfort zone.
