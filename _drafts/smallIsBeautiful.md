I learned about this book from the Systems View of Life book. Basically there is a Schumacher College in the United Kingdom which is all about interdisciplinary work. It about connecting people and thinking about the world issues. I don't think is really a place you get a degree from but it's not clear. The college was stated by the Satish Kumar who organizes the resurgence and ecologist and name the college after E. F. Schumacher, the author of this book.
He was an economist who wrote against the modern application of economic theory in society. This book was published in 1974 but ring full of truth in 2019 when I'm reading it.

## Part 1: The Modern World

### The Problem of Production

> Modern man does not experience himself as a part of nature but as an outside force destined to dominate and conquer it. He even talks of a battle with nature, forgetting that, if he won the battle, e would find himself on the losing side.
page 14

Economist make clear distinctions between capital and income. Income is an expendable source of wealth where as capital is the base on which one can build their income. When people talk of "natural capital" they break this standard and treat thing capital as if it were income. Economist treat this capital as a constant our simple ignore it to make their effort fit into their artificially defined forms.


> The substance of man cannot be measured by Gross National Product. Perhaps it cannot be measure at all, except for certain symptoms of loss. However, this is not the place to go into the statistics of these symptoms, such as crime, drug addition, vandalism, mental breakdown, rebellion, and so forth. Statistics never prove anything.
page 21

Their has been a constant push for higher and most inclusive levels of quantification within economics. The statement that statistics never prove anything is a direct challenge to the push in this direction. Yes we can measure more and make inferences from those measurements but we are chasing a unobtainable goal will standing on woefully considered core assumptions.

### Peace and Permanence

The idea of peace and economic prosperity are spoken of hand and hand. The mordern economic ideology is that if universal prosperity is achieved then peace will follow.
It is based on the three following assumptions.
<br>
*First, that universal prosperity is possible;*
<br>
*Second, that its attainment is possible on the basis of the materialist philosophy of "enrich yourselves";*
<br>
*Third, that this is the road to peace.*
<br>

In what again reads as a direct rebuttal to this set of assumptions comes the following.

> The question with which to start my investication is obviously this: Is there enough to go road? Immediately we encounter a serious difficulty: What is "enough"? Who can tell us? Certainly not the economist who pursues "economic growth" as the higest of all values, and therefore has no concept of "enough". There are poor societies which have too little; but where is the rich society that says; "Halt! We have enough"? There is none.
Page 25

This is expanded upon illustrating that is those who how that most that are pushing the conflict and most significantly effect the rate of change and so called growth. This is illustrated through energy consumption. A primary product that is by and large extract from natural capital.

> If human vices such as greed and envy are systematically cultivated, the inevitable result is nothing less than a collapse of intelligence. A man driven by greed or envy loses the power of seeing things as they really are, of seeing things in their roundness and wholeness, and his very success becomes failures. If whole societies become infected by these vices, they may indeed achieve astonishing things but they become increasingly incapable of solving the most elementary problems of everyday existence.
page 32

While explicitly stated else where in the book, greed and envy are the powerful human emotions that allows our modern economic philosophy to reign in liue of the falicies of it's underlying assumptions. Greed and envy are powerful motivators that can be used to create impressive things but in focusing on them as motivators we lose tract of the real value of human existence.

> The cultivation and expansion of needs is the antithesis of wisdom. It is also the antithesis of freedom and peace. Every increase of needs tends to increase one's dependence on outside forces over which one cannot have control, and therefore increases existential fear. Only by a reduction of needs can one promote a genuine reduction in those tensions which are the ultimate causes of strife and war.
page 34

Instead of pursuing prosperity through material wealth the path to peace requires a reduction in the number of needs. Needing something that we can not provide for ourselves is the source of conflict.

> Next to the family, it is work and the relationships established by work that are the true foundation of society. If the foundations are unsound, how could society be sounds? And id society is sick, how could it fail to be a danger to peace?
page 38

There is extensive discussion on the importance of work to the human character. Work needs to be something that reflect the innovative and creative expressions of the worker. Jobs that are highly standardize or highly automated are against the needs of the people and will erode their own quality of existence. Modern economy promotes these unhuman work because they can be more cost efficient.

> The soul-destroying, meaningless, mechanical, monotonous, moronic work is an insult to human nature which must necessarily and inevitably produce either escapism or aggression, and that not about of "bread and circuses" can compensate for the damage done - these are facts which are neither denied nor acknowledged but are met with an unbreakable conspiracy of silence - because to deny them would be too obviously absurd and to acknowledge them would condemn the central preoccupation of modern society as a crime against humanity.
page 39

It there was any doubt that Schumacher was going to hold things back to appeal to more general audience this paragraph smashed that idea.

> How could we even begin to disarm greed and envy? Perhaps by being much less greedy and envious ourselves; perhaps by resisting the temptation of letting our luxuries becomes needs: and perhaps by even scrutinizing our needs to see if they cannot be simplified and reduced. If we do not have the strength to do any of this, could we perhaps stop applauding the type of economic "progress" which palpably lacks the basis of permanence and give what modest support we can to those who, unafraid of being denounced as cranks, work for non-violence: as conservationists, ecologist, protectors of wildlife, promoters of organic agriculture, distributists, cottage producers and so forth? An ounce of practice is generally worth more than a ton of theory.
page 40

This is the content that makes me want to keep reading. Some actionable suggestions for how to would against some a embedded force that it can literally hide in plain sight. It's not all doom and gloom at the individual level. How we act and whom we support is the basis for building a culture outside of materialism.

> There must be recognition of the existence of the soul apart from the body, and of its permanent nature, and this recognition must amount to a living faith; and, in the last resort, nonviolence does not avail those who do not possess a living faith in the God of Love.
Gandhi
page 41

### The role of economics

> Society, or a group or an individual within society, may decide to hand on to an activity or asset *for non-economic reasons* - social, aesthetic, moral, or political - but this does in no way alter its *uneconomic* character. The judgement of economics, in other words, is an extremely *fragmentary* judgement; out of the larger number of aspects which in real life have to be seen and judged together before a decision can be taken, economics supplies only one - whether a thing yields a money profit *to those who undertake it* or not.
page 45

Economic thought take complex questions and supplies a binary result of their worth. Will we make more or not. This simplification, as with most simplification introduces multiple assumptions and hides the reality of such decisions. Why it is so prominent is being the choice is only make in consideration of those who choose it. What cost come to those outside of the one making the choice is not considered. This is particularly true with the use of natural capital because unlike people it does not have a directed voice of opposition.

> There is no probing into the depths of things, into the natural or social facts that lie behind them. In a sense, the market is the institutionalization of individualism and non-responsibility. Neither buyer nor seller is responsible for anything but himself.
page 46

The market economy effectively hides the cost and processes that went into the creation of objects. It allows a guilt free purchase remove the extraneities of such actions.

> To equate things means to give them a price and thus to make them exchangeable. To the extent that economic thinking is based on the market, it take the sacredness out of life, because there can be nothing sacred in something that has a price.
page 48

This just got me thinking about the things I would never want to sell. The idea that money value doesn't fit in the realm of the scared or spiritual speak to the importance of spirituality in countering the economic deadening of cultural well being.

> Ever science is beneficial within its proper limits, but becomes evil and destructive as soon as it transgresses them.
page 49

All sciences are based on theories which contain assumptions and parameters to help define the systems that which they describe. As a practicing scientist you have to know how your work fits into the those underlying theories, because when you step outside of them you move off the foundation on which they were formed. In a sense your making empty statements.

> An expansion of man's ability to bring forth secondary products is useless unless preceded by an expansion of his ability to win primary products from the earth; for man is not a producer but only a converter, and for every job of conversion he needs primary products.
page 52

This stems for a discussion that economics speaks of goods. All tradable values can have the same measured worth regradless of where they came from. Schumacher proposes that there are at a mimimun 4 basic units of goods.
- goods
    - primary
      - (1) non-renewable
      - (2) renewable
    - secondary
      - (3) manufacturers
      - (4) services

He claims that the modern economic system works well for describing manufactured goods but that is it. The fact the non-renewable resources do not hold a higher intristic value speaks to economist disregard to the future. In a quote I can't find at the moment, Keyens, a much cited economist makes the comment; We don't account for the future because in the future we are dead. This sums that idea that economics is driven by personal greed and envy very well.

> Obvious examples are the pursuit of supersonic transport speeds and the immense efforts make to land men on the moon. The conception of these aims was not the result of any insight into real human needs and aspirations, which technology is meant to serve, but solely of the fact that the necessary technology means appeared to be available
page 54

This gets at a human quality that has yet to be addressed, the need for exploration and discovery. We find magic and spiritual qualities in the questioning of the unknown. The struggle to something motivates our actions extensively. I came across this in a talk by Craig Childs on human migration into the Americas. They venture into the unknow quickly and extensively, it's part of what we do. Today exploration occurs in many ways, technological develop is just one. I would say by and large more adventurers don't ask the question will what comes back from the unknown be of help or hinderance to our society. It's simple what will come back from the unknown.


### Buddhist Economics
It's not clear just yet if this is Schumacher primary alternative economic structure but it certainly is one. I appreciate it because we're not trying to adjust the current systems to better fit the world, this is readjusting the primary assumptions of the economic system to better fit the world. The focus is really on the well being of people from doing meaningful work rather then making money.

> Equally, to strive for leisure as an alternative to work would be considered a complete misunderstanding of one of the basic truths of human existence, namely that work and leisure are complementary parts on the same living process and cannot be separated without destroying the joy of work and the bliss of leisure.
page 58

I believe this will resonate well with anyone who has been unemployed for an extended period of time. Work and leisure are complementary features. I think we value leisure so much because we don't effectively balance the too. Maybe this is  just an effect of the 40 hour week or how we focus within the leisure time. The message is that work should feel as valuable to your personal well being as leisure time does.

> While the materialist is mainly interested in foods, the Buddhist is mainly interested in liberation. But Buddhism is "The Middle Way" and therefore in no way antagonistic to physical well-being. IT is not wealth that stands in the way to liberation but the attachment to wealth; not the enjoyment of pleasurable things but the craving for them. The Keynote of Buddhist economist's point of view, the marvel of the Buddhist way of life is the utter rationality of its pattern - amazingly small mean leading to extraordinarily satisfactory results.
page 60

This felt like the definition of the whole process of Buddhist economics. Wealth and pleasure are still important aspects of life they just should not be the focus on it. By changing this focus one can find well being with less.

> As physical resources are everywhere limited, people satisfying their needs by means of a modest use of resources are obviously less likely to be at each other's throats than people depending upon high rate of use. Equally, people who live in highly self-sufficient local communities are less likely to get involved in large-scale violence than people whose existence depends on world-wide systems of trade.
page 62

This has been a frightening reality that has come up quite a bit in this book already. This book was written in the 1970's which is probably near the beinging of modern globalization. Today this amount of worldwide dependencies that are a part of our modern lives is staggering. If you following this logic, buying local is promoting peace.

> He tends to count nothing as an expenditure, other than human effort; he does not seem to mind how much mineral matter he wastes and, for worse, how much living matter he destroys. He does not seem to realize at all that human life is dependent part of an ecosystem of many different forms of life. As the world is ruled from towns where men are cut off from any form of life other than human, the feeling of belonging to an ecosystem is not revived. This results in a harsh and improvident treatment of things upon which we ultimately depend, such as water and trees.
> Bertrand De Jouvenel
> page 63

As the disconnect between everyday life and ecological systems grows the willingness to alter and take from the ecological systems grows as well. This is probably a large and realitively unaccounted for threat of urbanization.

> Just as a modern European economist would not consider it a great economic achievement if all European art treasures were sold to America at attractive prices, so the Buddhist economist would insist that a population basing its economic life on non-renewable fuels is living parasitically, on capital instead of income.
page 64

This is a great comparison on just exactly what a non renewable resource is. The idea of living off capital is strong message I'm taking away from this work. It give a tone of economic relevancy that I think will help speak with people who generally have no interest in natural systems

> As the world's resources of non-renewable fuels = coal, oil, and natural gas - are exceedingly unevenly distributed over the globe and undoubtedly limited in quantity, it is clear that their exploitation at an ever-increasing rate is an act of violence against nature which must almost inevitably lead to violence between men.
page 65

Again just defining the stakes and what our modern economy is pushing us to.
