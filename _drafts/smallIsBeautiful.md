I learned about this book from the Systems View of Life book. Basically there is a Schumacher College in the United Kingdom which is all about interdisciplinary work. It about connecting people and thinking about the world issues. I don't think is really a place you get a degree from but it's not clear. The college was stated by the Satish Kumar who organizes the resurgence and ecologist and name the college after E. F. Schumacher, the author of this book.
He was an economist who wrote against the modern application of economic theory in society. This book was published in 1974 but ring full of truth in 2019 when I'm reading it.

## Part 1: The Modern World

### The Problem of Production

> Modern man does not experience himself as a part of nature but as an outside force destined to dominate and conquer it. He even talks of a battle with nature, forgetting that, if he won the battle, e would find himself on the losing side.
page 14

Economist make clear distinctions between capital and income. Income is an expendable source of wealth where as capital is the base on which one can build their income. When people talk of "natural capital" they break this standard and treat thing capital as if it were income. Economist treat this capital as a constant our simple ignore it to make their effort fit into their artificially defined forms.


> The substance of man cannot be measured by Gross National Product. Perhaps it cannot be measure at all, except for certain symptoms of loss. However, this is not the place to go into the statistics of these symptoms, such as crime, drug addition, vandalism, mental breakdown, rebellion, and so forth. Statistics never prove anything.
page 21

Their has been a constant push for higher and most inclusive levels of quantification within economics. The statement that statistics never prove anything is a direct challenge to the push in this direction. Yes we can measure more and make inferences from those measurements but we are chasing a unobtainable goal will standing on woefully considered core assumptions.

### Peace and Permanence

The idea of peace and economic prosperity are spoken of hand and hand. The mordern economic ideology is that if universal prosperity is achieved then peace will follow.
It is based on the three following assumptions.
<br>
*First, that universal prosperity is possible;*
<br>
*Second, that its attainment is possible on the basis of the materialist philosophy of "enrich yourselves";*
<br>
*Third, that this is the road to peace.*
<br>

In what again reads as a direct rebuttal to this set of assumptions comes the following.

> The question with which to start my investication is obviously this: Is there enough to go road? Immediately we encounter a serious difficulty: What is "enough"? Who can tell us? Certainly not the economist who pursues "economic growth" as the higest of all values, and therefore has no concept of "enough". There are poor societies which have too little; but where is the rich society that says; "Halt! We have enough"? There is none.
Page 25

This is expanded upon illustrating that is those who how that most that are pushing the conflict and most significantly effect the rate of change and so called growth. This is illustrated through energy consumption. A primary product that is by and large extract from natural capital.

> If human vices such as greed and envy are systematically cultivated, the inevitable result is nothing less than a collapse of intelligence. A man driven by greed or envy loses the power of seeing things as they really are, of seeing things in their roundness and wholeness, and his very success becomes failures. If whole societies become infected by these vices, they may indeed achieve astonishing things but they become increasingly incapable of solving the most elementary problems of everyday existence.
page 32

While explicitly stated else where in the book, greed and envy are the powerful human emotions that allows our modern economic philosophy to reign in liue of the falicies of it's underlying assumptions. Greed and envy are powerful motivators that can be used to create impressive things but in focusing on them as motivators we lose tract of the real value of human existence.

> The cultivation and expansion of needs is the antithesis of wisdom. It is also the antithesis of freedom and peace. Every increase of needs tends to increase one's dependence on outside forces over which one cannot have control, and therefore increases existential fear. Only by a reduction of needs can one promote a genuine reduction in those tensions which are the ultimate causes of strife and war.
page 34

Instead of pursuing prosperity through material wealth the path to peace requires a reduction in the number of needs. Needing something that we can not provide for ourselves is the source of conflict.

> Next to the family, it is work and the relationships established by work that are the true foundation of society. If the foundations are unsound, how could society be sounds? And id society is sick, how could it fail to be a danger to peace?
page 38

There is extensive discussion on the importance of work to the human character. Work needs to be something that reflect the innovative and creative expressions of the worker. Jobs that are highly standardize or highly automated are against the needs of the people and will erode their own quality of existence. Modern economy promotes these unhuman work because they can be more cost efficient.

> The soul-destroying, meaningless, mechanical, monotonous, moronic work is an insult to human nature which must necessarily and inevitably produce either escapism or aggression, and that not about of "bread and circuses" can compensate for the damage done - these are facts which are neither denied nor acknowledged but are met with an unbreakable conspiracy of silence - because to deny them would be too obviously absurd and to acknowledge them would condemn the central preoccupation of modern society as a crime against humanity.
page 39

It there was any doubt that Schumacher was going to hold things back to appeal to more general audience this paragraph smashed that idea.

> How could we even begin to disarm greed and envy? Perhaps by being much less greedy and envious ourselves; perhaps by resisting the temptation of letting our luxuries becomes needs: and perhaps by even scrutinizing our needs to see if they cannot be simplified and reduced. If we do not have the strength to do any of this, could we perhaps stop applauding the type of economic "progress" which palpably lacks the basis of permanence and give what modest support we can to those who, unafraid of being denounced as cranks, work for non-violence: as conservationists, ecologist, protectors of wildlife, promoters of organic agriculture, distributists, cottage producers and so forth? An ounce of practice is generally worth more than a ton of theory.
page 40

This is the content that makes me want to keep reading. Some actionable suggestions for how to would against some a embedded force that it can literally hide in plain sight. It's not all doom and gloom at the individual level. How we act and whom we support is the basis for building a culture outside of materialism.

> There must be recognition of the existence of the soul apart from the body, and of its permanent nature, and this recognition must amount to a living faith; and, in the last resort, nonviolence does not avail those who do not possess a living faith in the God of Love.
Gandhi
page 41

### The role of economics

> Society, or a group or an individual within society, may decide to hand on to an activity or asset *for non-economic reasons* - social, aesthetic, moral, or political - but this does in no way alter its *uneconomic* character. The judgement of economics, in other words, is an extremely *fragmentary* judgement; out of the larger number of aspects which in real life have to be seen and judged together before a decision can be taken, economics supplies only one - whether a thing yields a money profit *to those who undertake it* or not.
page 45

Economic thought take complex questions and supplies a binary result of their worth. Will we make more or not. This simplification, as with most simplification introduces multiple assumptions and hides the reality of such decisions. Why it is so prominent is being the choice is only make in consideration of those who choose it. What cost come to those outside of the one making the choice is not considered. This is particularly true with the use of natural capital because unlike people it does not have a directed voice of opposition.

> There is no probing into the depths of things, into the natural or social facts that lie behind them. In a sense, the market is the institutionalization of individualism and non-responsibility. Neither buyer nor seller is responsible for anything but himself.
page 46

The market economy effectively hides the cost and processes that went into the creation of objects. It allows a guilt free purchase remove the extraneities of such actions.

> To equate things means to give them a price and thus to make them exchangeable. To the extent that economic thinking is based on the market, it take the sacredness out of life, because there can be nothing sacred in something that has a price.
page 48

This just got me thinking about the things I would never want to sell. The idea that money value doesn't fit in the realm of the scared or spiritual speak to the importance of spirituality in countering the economic deadening of cultural well being.

> Ever science is beneficial within its proper limits, but becomes evil and destructive as soon as it transgresses them.
page 49

All sciences are based on theories which contain assumptions and parameters to help define the systems that which they describe. As a practicing scientist you have to know how your work fits into the those underlying theories, because when you step outside of them you move off the foundation on which they were formed. In a sense your making empty statements.

> An expansion of man's ability to bring forth secondary products is useless unless preceded by an expansion of his ability to win primary products from the earth; for man is not a producer but only a converter, and for every job of conversion he needs primary products.
page 52

This stems for a discussion that economics speaks of goods. All tradable values can have the same measured worth regradless of where they came from. Schumacher proposes that there are at a mimimun 4 basic units of goods.
- goods
    - primary
      - (1) non-renewable
      - (2) renewable
    - secondary
      - (3) manufacturers
      - (4) services

He claims that the modern economic system works well for describing manufactured goods but that is it. The fact the non-renewable resources do not hold a higher intristic value speaks to economist disregard to the future. In a quote I can't find at the moment, Keyens, a much cited economist makes the comment; We don't account for the future because in the future we are dead. This sums that idea that economics is driven by personal greed and envy very well.

> Obvious examples are the pursuit of supersonic transport speeds and the immense efforts make to land men on the moon. The conception of these aims was not the result of any insight into real human needs and aspirations, which technology is meant to serve, but solely of the fact that the necessary technology means appeared to be available
page 54

This gets at a human quality that has yet to be addressed, the need for exploration and discovery. We find magic and spiritual qualities in the questioning of the unknown. The struggle to something motivates our actions extensively. I came across this in a talk by Craig Childs on human migration into the Americas. They venture into the unknow quickly and extensively, it's part of what we do. Today exploration occurs in many ways, technological develop is just one. I would say by and large more adventurers don't ask the question will what comes back from the unknown be of help or hinderance to our society. It's simple what will come back from the unknown.


### Buddhist Economics
It's not clear just yet if this is Schumacher primary alternative economic structure but it certainly is one. I appreciate it because we're not trying to adjust the current systems to better fit the world, this is readjusting the primary assumptions of the economic system to better fit the world. The focus is really on the well being of people from doing meaningful work rather then making money.

> Equally, to strive for leisure as an alternative to work would be considered a complete misunderstanding of one of the basic truths of human existence, namely that work and leisure are complementary parts on the same living process and cannot be separated without destroying the joy of work and the bliss of leisure.
page 58

I believe this will resonate well with anyone who has been unemployed for an extended period of time. Work and leisure are complementary features. I think we value leisure so much because we don't effectively balance the too. Maybe this is  just an effect of the 40 hour week or how we focus within the leisure time. The message is that work should feel as valuable to your personal well being as leisure time does.

> While the materialist is mainly interested in foods, the Buddhist is mainly interested in liberation. But Buddhism is "The Middle Way" and therefore in no way antagonistic to physical well-being. IT is not wealth that stands in the way to liberation but the attachment to wealth; not the enjoyment of pleasurable things but the craving for them. The Keynote of Buddhist economist's point of view, the marvel of the Buddhist way of life is the utter rationality of its pattern - amazingly small mean leading to extraordinarily satisfactory results.
page 60

This felt like the definition of the whole process of Buddhist economics. Wealth and pleasure are still important aspects of life they just should not be the focus on it. By changing this focus one can find well being with less.

> As physical resources are everywhere limited, people satisfying their needs by means of a modest use of resources are obviously less likely to be at each other's throats than people depending upon high rate of use. Equally, people who live in highly self-sufficient local communities are less likely to get involved in large-scale violence than people whose existence depends on world-wide systems of trade.
page 62

This has been a frightening reality that has come up quite a bit in this book already. This book was written in the 1970's which is probably near the beinging of modern globalization. Today this amount of worldwide dependencies that are a part of our modern lives is staggering. If you following this logic, buying local is promoting peace.

> He tends to count nothing as an expenditure, other than human effort; he does not seem to mind how much mineral matter he wastes and, for worse, how much living matter he destroys. He does not seem to realize at all that human life is dependent part of an ecosystem of many different forms of life. As the world is ruled from towns where men are cut off from any form of life other than human, the feeling of belonging to an ecosystem is not revived. This results in a harsh and improvident treatment of things upon which we ultimately depend, such as water and trees.
> Bertrand De Jouvenel
> page 63

As the disconnect between everyday life and ecological systems grows the willingness to alter and take from the ecological systems grows as well. This is probably a large and realitively unaccounted for threat of urbanization.

> Just as a modern European economist would not consider it a great economic achievement if all European art treasures were sold to America at attractive prices, so the Buddhist economist would insist that a population basing its economic life on non-renewable fuels is living parasitically, on capital instead of income.
page 64

This is a great comparison on just exactly what a non renewable resource is. The idea of living off capital is strong message I'm taking away from this work. It give a tone of economic relevancy that I think will help speak with people who generally have no interest in natural systems

> As the world's resources of non-renewable fuels = coal, oil, and natural gas - are exceedingly unevenly distributed over the globe and undoubtedly limited in quantity, it is clear that their exploitation at an ever-increasing rate is an act of violence against nature which must almost inevitably lead to violence between men.
page 65

Again just defining the stakes and what our modern economy is pushing us to.


## Chapter 5: A Question of Size

Timely chapter that gets at the relationship between individual motivation and governance
This is the first time in the book where it’s age has really started to so. The idea of a footloose population that moves from place to place is spoken of an a potentially troublesome idea because it reduces the sense of regionalism which move subsequent ideas are founded. The amount to which people are footloose today seems to extend beyond the believed potential of the author.


> In the affairs of men, there always appears to be a need for at least two things simultaneously, which, on the face of it, seem to be incompatible and to exclude one another. We always need both freedom and order. We need the freedom of lots and lots of small, autonomous units and m at the same time, the orderliness of larger-scale, possibly global, unity and coordination. When it comes to action, we obviously need small units, because action is a highly personal affair, and one cannot be in touch with more than a very limited number of persons at an one time. But when it comes to the world of ideas, to principles or to ethics, to the indivisibility of peace and also ecology, we need to recognise the unity of mankind and base our actions upon this recognition.

This frames the challenge of size well. We action at the personal level but require the stability of higher levels of governance. What’s hard is that things that affect you personal are easy to recognize and workwith. Those important structure that don’t make it into you day to day life are still important one just has to make an effort to realize so. Making an effort can a difficult thing for people to do and a very challenging thing to expect.

> There is no such thing as the viability of states or of nations, there is only a problem of viability of people: people, actual persons like you and me, are viable when they can stand on their own feet and earn their own keep. You do not make non-viable people viable by putting large numbers of them into aonehuge community, and you do not make viablke people non-viable by spliting a large community into a number of smaller, more intimate, more coherent and more manageable groups. All this is perfectly obvious and there is absolutely nothing to argue about.

I love this because it states the being viable (which I also associate with having some form of success) is something that should be done at the perosnal level. Governence does not allow and prevent it from happening. We don’t have to continue to build into the cerntalized power of citiesbased on the false notion that it promotes well being. It’s about the individual.

> But it does make a lot of difference if a poor community or province finds itself politically tied to or ruled by a rich community or province. Why? Because, in a mobile, footloose society the law of disequilibrium is infinitely stronger than the so-called law of equilibrium. Nothing succeeds like success and nothing stagnatwes like stagnation. The successful province drains the life out of the unsuccessful, and without protection against the strong, the weak have no chance; either they remain weak or they must migrate and join the strong; they cannot effectively help themselves.

An application of the adage, it takes money to make money, to social structures at a larger scale. This is something that I wish people talked about more. People in places that are struggling to make it are much more affected by the actions of those in place with the power and viability.  

> A most important problem in the second half of the twentieth century is the geographic distribution of population, the question of “regionalism.” But regionalism, not in the sense of combining a lot of states into free-trade systems, but in opposite sense of develop all the regions within each country.

Tying things back to the quote above. Distribution of power and the opportunity for the viability of the individual is what will allow the success of all areas of a country.

> What is the meaning of democracy, freedom, human dignity, standard of living, self-realisation, fulfilment? It is a matter of goods, or of people? Of course it is a matter of people. But people can be themselves only in small comprehensible groups. Therefore we must learn to think in terms of an articulated structure that can cope with a multiplicity of small-scale units. If economic thinking cannot grasp this it is useless. If it cannot get beyond its vast abstractions, the national income,the rate of growth, capital/output ratio, input-output analysis, labour mobility, capital accumulation; if it cannot get beyond all this and make contact with the human realities of poverty, frustration, alienation, despair, breakdown, crime, escapism, stress, congestion, ugliness, and spiritual death, then let us scrap economics and start afresh.

I just love the passion in this writing. This is a call to stop trying to fit our lives to a system that does not capture humanity. Instead, forget that system and work on generating one that can.

# Part II Resources

## The Greatest Resource - Education

Having spent a lot of time working in the field of education and thinking about the challenges that are discussed about it, I was pleasantly surprised when this chapter went in a entirely different direction. Education, for the author, is the systems that instills a sense of place and value for the individual within the world.  

> The classical statement on this point was delivered by Sir Charles(now Lord) Snow in his Rede Lecture some years ago: “To say that we must educate ourselves or perish, is a little more melodramatic than the facts warrant. To say, we have to educate ourselves or watch a steep decline in our lifetime is about right.”

Education has the potential to help create viability of the individual. Finding what it is we want to be educated on and seeking that out is a means of taking initiative of our own well being. We’re not doomed if we don’t we will just watch as our place and positions in society decline.

 > The essence of education, I suggested, is the transmission of values, but values do not help us to pick our way through life unless they have become our own, a part, so to say, of our mental make-up. This means that they are more than mere formulae or dogmatic assertions: that we think feel with them, that they are the very instruments through which we look at, interpret, and experience the world. When we think, we do not just think: we think with ideas. Our mind is not a black, a *tabula rasa*. When we begin to think we can do so only because our mind is already filled with all sorts of ideas *with which* to think.

Values define the framework from what we make decision and the role of education is to instill those values so they become an ingrained part of a person life.

> The way in which we experience and interpret the world obviously depends very much indeed on the kind of ideas that fill our minds. If they are mainly small, weak, superficial, and incoherent, life will appear insipid, uninteresting, petty and chaotic. It is difficult to bear the resultant feeling of emptiness, and the vacuum of our minds may only too easily be filled by some big, fantastic notion - political or otherwise - which suddenly seems to illumine everything and to give meaning and purpose to our existence, it needs no emphasis that herein lies one of the great dangers of our time.  

This connects directly to the ideas spoken to in Winifred Gallagher book Rapt. We get to decide where to put our attention. How effective we are at the this and depth of the subject that we commit to go a long way inshaping our own well being. With out the ability to define our own focus we allow our interest and well being to be defined by others.

> Science cannot produce ideas by which we could live. Even the greatest ideas of science are nothing more than working hypotheses, useful for purposes of special research but completely inapplicable to the conduct of our lives or the interpretation of the world. If, therefore, a man seeks education because he feels estranged and bewildered, because his life seems to him empty and meaningless, he cannot get what he is seeking by studying any of the natural science, i.e. by acquiring “know-how.” That study has its own value which I am not inclined to belittle; it tells him a great deal about how things work in nature or in engineering; but it tells him nothing about the meaning of life and can in no way cure his estrangement and secret despair.

While not tossing out the value of natural science that sentiment is rather clear, education can not be about know-how because that does not provide an sense of value and therefore fails the primary goal of education.

>”Shall I teach youthe meaning of knowledge?” said Confucius. “When you know a thing to recognise that you know it, and when you do not, to know that you do not know - that is knowledge.”

This was defined as consciously incompetent. Knowing what you don’t know.  Part of my training in outdoor education was self assessment. Really nice to hear it come up as a confucius quote.


> The problems of education are merely reflections of the deepest problems of our are. They cannot be solved by organization, administration, or expenditure of money, even though the importance of all theses is not denied. We are suffering from a metaphysical disease, and the cure must therefore be metaphysical. Education which fails to clarify our central convictions that are mere training or indulgence. For it is out central convictions that are in disorder and as long as the present anti-metaphysical temper persists, the disorder will grow worse. Education,, far from running as man’s greatest resource, will then be an agent of destruction in accordance with the principle *corruotio optimi pessima*.

Having read a few chapters ahead at the time of writing this I can see that this really sets the tone for whats to come. Metaphysical problems, or lack of metaphysical beliefs is whats allowing the economic dogma to gain ground. The current educational system does not provide meaning or purpose to life and the authors view is that if it did only that it would vast more successful then it currently is. I’m still going back and forth with the idea. What really stand out is that without central convictions, we’re guided by something else. That idea alone explains alot.

## 2 The Proper Use of Land

The author starts to pull in a lot of biblical statements regarding land use. I really like this because it ties the issue to a large and longer lived cultural identity. It’s clear from the previous chapters that Schumacher is not looking for a technical solution here but a spiritual or metaphysical rebalance. You can’t go to science for that.

> The “Ecological problem,” it seems, is not as new as it is frequently made out to be. Yet there are two decisive differences: the earth is now much more densely populated than it was in earlier times and there are, generally speaking, no new lands to move to; and the rate of change has enormously accelerated, particularly during the last quarter of a century.
All the same, it is still the dominant belief today that, whatever may have happened with earlier civilzations , our own modern Western civilization has emancipated itself from dependence upon nature.
Page 110

To big points in this. 1) We can still use history to understand the present. 2) Civilizations collapse due to an inability for the natural environment to meet their needs. The idea that we are not part of natural system is a common believe, but not in the manner that we are not part of the Earth ( for most people would believe that we are indeed on it). It is an idea that our technological advancements have provided us alternatives to the systems the Earth provides. While this is true in areas such as entertainment, the approached is applied as a blanket across all realms of thought to protect us with ignorance from the real challenges we are creating.

*Noblesse obilge* the inferred responsibility of privileged people to act with generosity and nobility toward those less privileged.

This term comes up a lot. Mostly in reference to humans relationship to animals. The idea is such that how you treat those less fortunate defines how you would treat a peer.

There is a lot of effort put into explain how economist view man as a producer and a consumer. Basically different laws apply to both although that are the same person. Anything that falls in the realm of production fits into the economic calculus. Thing that would be uneconomical at the production level are generally sought after as standard of a high standard of living on the consumption side. I’m not entirely clear on this process but much like the idea of natural capitial this is vernacular that is used and discussed by economist.

>In other words, there can be no doubt that the fundamental “principles” of agriculture and if industry, far from being compatible with each other, are in opposition. Real life consists of the tensions produced by the incompatibility of opposites, each of which is needed, and just as life would be meaningless without industry. It remains true, however, that agriculture is primary, whereas industry is secondary, which means that human life can continue without industry, whereas it cannot continue without agriculture. Human life at the level of civilization, however, demands the *balance* of the two principles, and this balance is ineluctably destroyed when people fail to appreciate the *essential difference between agriculture and industry - a difference as great as that between life and death - and attempt to treat agriculture as just another industry.
Page 118

This highly binary division between agriculture and industry seems to stem from the metaphysical value that the author places on agriculture. Growing food at a human scale is the mechanism that brings people minds and identities back to the Earth. It’s a process for providing that metaphysical support and understanding of the systems on which we rely.

> No serious exception can be taken to theses statements if we adopt - as the experts have adopted - the metaphysical position of the crudest materialism, for which money cost and money incomes are the ultimate criteria and determinants of human action, *and the living world has no significance beyond that of a quarry for exploitation.*
	On a wider view, however, the land is seen as a priceless asset which it is man’s taks and happiness “to dress and to keep.” We can say that man’s management of the land must be primarily oriented towards three goals - health, beauty, and permanence. The fourth goal - the only one accepted by the experts - productivity, will then be attained almost as a by-product. The crude materialist view sees agriculture as “essentially directed towards food-production.” A wider view sees agriculture as having to fulfill at least three task:
To keep man in touch with living nature of which he is and remains a highly vulnerable part;
To humanise and ennoble man’s wider habitat; and
To bring forth the foodstuffs and other materials which are needed for a becoming life.
Page 119/120

A big passage that holds a lot. The assumptions built around modern agriculture make sense when they are founded in the constructruct of materialism. I appreciate that Schumacher refers to the metaphysical position of crudest materialism as a means of supporting the importance of a metaphysical reason for living. If you don’t define one yourself you will be strongly influenced by the most prominent one in our culture.
The three tenets of agriculture are something I can really buy into. Building a space to grow plants give you a deeper connection with the land but it also can feel like your giving back to it. It’s a mutual support. They challenge becomes one of scale. Surely the interaction with the dirt feels much different if feel through a shovel compared to a tractor.

> All this is being done because man-as-producer cannot afford “the luxury of not acting economically,” and therefore cannot produce the very necessary “luxuries” - like health, beauty, and permanence - which man-as-consumer desires more than anything else. It would cost too much; and the richer we become, the less can “afford.”  
Page 122

The dichotomy of the producer and consumer explained value well. A seemingly self defeating structure.

> In fact, any society can afford to look after its land and keep it healthy and beautiful in perpetuity. There are no technical difficulties and there is no lack of relevant knowledge. There is no need to consult economic experts when the question is one of priorities. We know to much about ecology today to have any excuse for the many abuses that are currently going on in the management of the land, in the management of animals, in food storage, food processing, and in heedless urbanisation. If we permit them, this is not due to poverty, as if we could not afford to stop to stop them; it is due to the fact that, as a society, we have no firm basis of belief in any meta-economic values, and when there is no such belief the economic calculus takes over. This is quite inevitable. How could it be otherwise? Nature, it has been said, abhors a vacuum, and when the available “spiritual space” is not filled by some higher motivation, then it will necessarily be filled by something lower - by the small, mean, calculating attitude to life which is rationalised in the economic calculus.
Page 123

Here is the summary of the theme that has been building. We know we can get around the environmental concern, but it requires of metaphysical change. A replacement of the crude materialistic ideology with something more balanced and focused. Nothing currently is competing with the world view of accumulation of things and therefore it difficult to not seem the current systems an one and only reality.

## 3 Resources for Industry
This was not the most impactful chapter. You can tell that Schumacher has a bit of a bone to pick with policy that affected the coal industry in England. It does really drive home the unsustainable use of industry.

> Nor does it require the study of large numbers of commodities, of trends, feedback loops, system dynamics, and so forth, to come to the conclusion *that time is hort.* Maybe it was useful to employ a computer for obtaining results which any intelligent person can reach with the help of a few calculations on the back of an envelope, because the modern world believes in computers and masses of facts, and it abhors simplicity.
Page 129

This is a message Im really taking to heart. We’re devising more complicated models to explain something that is obvious. We’re supporting the cultural trend to look to date as truth. I don’t know if there is a way around it or something one can do about it but I think it’s something we need to be aware off and address.

> It might be said that energy is for the mechanical world what consciousness is for the human world. If energy fails, everything fails.
Page 130

Hard to argue with this reality. Our world is defined by energy use. Even the basic foundations of life are built upon engery. I’ve heard somewhere of the idea that energy should be the unit of exchange. You don’t trade in dollars but in energy. There probably more to that idea but just highlights it ubiquitous character.

> It is fashionable today to assume that any figures about the future are better than none. To produce figures about the unknown, the current method is to make a guess about something or other - called an ‘assumption’ - and to derive an estimate from it by subtle calculation. The estimate is then presented as the result of scientific reasoning, something far superior to mere guess work. This is a pernicious practice which can only lead to the most colossal planning errors, because it offers a bogus answer where, in fact, an entrepreneurial judgement is required.
	The study here under review employs a vast array of arbitrary assumptions, which are then, as it were, put into a calculating machine to produce a “scientific” result. It would have been cheaper, and indeed more honest, simply to assume the results. 1975
Page 132
Powerful critique to the potential of future modeling parameters. If you make base level assumptions at the start of the process it is difficult to have the end product stand on anything other than it’s only assumptions.

> It used to be said that O.P.E.C. - the organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries - would never amount to anything, because Arabs could never agree with each other, let alone with non-Arabs; today it is clear that O.P.E.C. is the greatest cartel-monopoly the world has ever seen. It used to be said that the oil exporting countries *depoend* on the oil importing countries just as much as the latter depend of the former; today it is clear that this is based on nothing but wishful thinging, because the need of the oil consumers is so greaet and their demand so inelastic that the oil exporting countries acting in unison, can infact raise their revenues by the simple device of curtailing output. There are still people who say that if oil price rose too much (whatever that may mean) oil would simply price itself out of the market; but it is perfectly obvious that there is no ready substitute for oil to take its place on a quantitatively significant scale, so that oil, in fact, cannot price itself out of the market.
Page 139

It’s been great getting to read the statements of the past the have only become more true today, nearly 50 years later. It’s not clear to me at the moment but what have fought multiple wars to support the O.P.E.C. countries so they will continue to provide oil. It is the cornerstone of our transportation system which moves stuff around so we can by it. It’s the base unit of crude materialism. It’s a frightening thing to think of that level of dependency at any scale.

> The greatest danger to both is a continuation of rapid growth in oil production and consumption throughout the world. Catastrophic developments on the oil front could be avoided only if the *basic harmony of the long-term interest of both groups of countries*  came to be fully realised and concerted action were taken to stabilise and gradually reduce the annual flow of oil into consumption.
Page 140

This is an interesting perspective. To avoid the boom bust nature of natural resource extraction the oil companies have an interest in slowing consumption.  I hope that they are that forward looking. This also reminded me of an interpretation of the reduce, reuse, recycle adage. It’s spoken in ranked order of importance. Reduce consumption is the most important thing. We have a hard time with that in general.

### 4 Nuclear Energy - Salvation or Damnation?

It good to hear the perspective of nuclear energy from someone who lived through the nuclear age. In some way the lack of acceptance of nuclear energy is a tribute to the ideas of this text. Not just running ahead with the new process but evaluating it's work and danger to the future. The hope is that the same mindset can be apply to less extreme aspects.

>The religion of economics promotes an idolatry of rapid change, unaffected by the elementary truism that a change which is not an unquestionable improvement is a doubtful blessings. The burden of proof is place on those who take the "ecological viewpoint": unless *they* can produce evidence of marked injury to man, the change will proceed. Common sense, on the contrary, would suggest that the burden of proof should lie on the man who wants to introduce a change; he has to demonstrate that there cannot be any damaging consequences. But this would take too much time, and would therefore be uneconomic. Ecology, indeed, out to be a compulsory subject for all economist, whether professionals or laymen, as this might serve to restore at least a modicum of balance. For ecology holds "that an environment  that an environmental setting developed over millions of years must be considered to have some merit. Anything so complicated as a planet, inhabited by more than a million and a half species of plant and animals, all of them living together in a more or less balanced equilibrium in which they continuously use and re-use the same molecules of the soil and air, cannot be improved by aimless and uninformed tinkering. All changes in a complex mechanism involve some risk and should be undertaken  only after careful study of all the facts available. Changes should be made on a small scale first so as to provide a test before they are widely applied. When information is incomplete, changes should stay close to the actual processes which have in their favor the indisputable evidence of having supported life for a very long time."
page 142/143

I wrote this for description of ecology and really systems thinking at the end of the day. We should approach changes to existing complex systems with a high degree of caution and respect.

> Discussed nuclear power stations will stand as unsightly monuments to unquiet man's assumption that nothing but tranquility, from now on, stretches before him, or else - that the future counts as nothing compared with the slightest economic gain now.
page 146

Radio activity as a waste produce last a long time. The idea that these reactors remain present and abandon on the land scape is a good imagery to the point of making decisions for short term gains only.

> At the Fourth National Cancer Conference in America in September 1960, Lester Breslow of the California Stat Department of Public Health reported that tens of thousands of trout in western hatcheries suddenly acquired liver cancers, and continued thus: " Technological changes affecting man's environment are being introduced at such a rapid rate and with so little control that it is a wonder man has thus far escaped the type of cancer epidemic occurring this year among the trout."
page 150

I've always been curious about how common cancer has been in the past and what the relationship is between technological advancements and cancer. The fact that professional conference for the topic began in the 1950's give some scope of the time line. I just hope it's not something that comes to the surface years from now. We were the cause of the leading killer of people.

> Man cannot live without science and technology any more than he can live against nature. What needs the most careful consideration, however, is the *direction* of scientific research. We cannot leave this to the scientist alone. As Einstein himself said, " almost all scientist are economically completely dependent" and " the number of scientists who possess a sense of social responsibility is so small" that they cannot determine the direction of research.
page 151

Another critique of science as a whole and a very real one. We need technologicaly development it's just who decides where that development is put is not doing so for moral reasons. This means that scientist are playing a direct role in the future endangerment of our people under the guise of progress.

> No degree of prosperity could justify the accumulation of large amounts of highly toxic substances which nobody knows how to make "safe" and which remain an incalculable danger to the whole creation for historical or even geological ages. To do such a thing is transgression against life itself, transgression infinitely more serious than any crime ever perpetrated by man. The idea that a civilization could sustain itself on the basis of such a transgression is an ethical, spiritual, and metaphysical monstrosity. It means conducting the economic affairs of man as it people really did not matter at all.
Page 154

The concluding paragraph and a very strong one. This firmly cements the authors ideas about how the present should treat the future.

### 5 Technology with a Human Face

Not as impactful of a chapter for me. Probably because technology is so much part of my life already. A lot has changed on this front over the last 50 yets. Still some good statements that still make sense today.

> What is quite clear is that a way of life that bases itself on materialism, i.e. on permanent, limitless expansionism in a finite environment cannot last long, and that its life expectation is the short the more successfully it pursues its expansionist objectives.
page 156

A rephrasing of a core and still really unsubstantiated foundation assumption of economic, unlimited growth in a finite system. This only seems like enough to get people to slow, it's good to see it continuously come up.

The author speaks alot about the value of production at the human level. Or need to create things that we understand with our hands. He claims that as technology increases what it really is doing is taking out those base level production jobs. There is a some statistical extrapolation to claim that there on average is only >4% of onces life spent in the time of producion. The claim is that technology should be working to increase not decrease this percentage. To me this can be best exemplified by the different between the work of an artist and a clerk. Our economy support far more clerks then artists. 

> Now, it might be said that this is a romantic, a utopian, vision. True enough. What we have today , in modern industrial society, is not romantic and certainly not utopian, as we have it right here. But it is in very deep trouble and holds no promise of survival. The threefold crisis of which I have spoke will not fo away if we simply carry on as before. It will become worse and end in disaster, until or unless we develop a new life-style which is compatible with the real needs of human nature, with the health of living nature around us, and with the resource endownment of the world.
page 162

This seems like a little bit of self justificant for why we should continue to dream big and attempt to reach the goals even if they seem far fatched. Strive for something better while knowing it's a long shot. I tend to agree with this. The ideas I've been speaking are easily brushed off as childish and simplistic. Kailee has even been mentioning that it make me sound less intellegent. Still it's how I want to talk about these process. What to what you want don't settle for what has been given.

> In a sense, everybody believes in growth, and rightly so, because growth is an essential feature of life. The whole point, however, is to give to the idea of growth a qualitative determination; for there are always many thing that ought to be growing and many things that ought to be diminishing.
page 167

I appreciate this because it highlights that most issues are really a matter of framing the processes. We can have growth it's just that we don't need growth in consumption as much as we needs growth in well being.
