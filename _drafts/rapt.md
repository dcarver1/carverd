# Introduction: Choosing the Focused Life


> I'll live the focused life, because it's the best kind there is.
page 14

This is the last line of the chapter but is also the primary theme of the book. Through focus we can define the quality of our life. This is supported by the fact that focus allows one to control what the mind is doing. Controlling the mind allow one to live in the present moment. Being in the present give us the agency to gain control over our actions. This agency allow us to build our own sense of well being.
Like most processes, it is easier said then done. The author was motivated by a major life effect of battling cancer to build her will of living a focused life. It seems her goal for this book is to prove that you don't need to be fighting for your life to take control and focus.  

# Chapter 1: Pay Attention: Your Life Depends on It

We can only concentrate an a small portion of the stimulus the world provides. As a result our lives are filled with features that are either *in focus* or *out of focus*

There are two mechanisms by which our attention can be captured.
**Bottom up attention** Stimulus that appeals to our base level want for novelty and uniqueness. This is a the core tactic of advertisement and is generally something we do not have control over. This type of attention takes like or no mental energy so we always have to deal with it.

**top down attention** the individual deciding what to focus on. The brain understand the character of the stimulus and makes that the feature that will most readily stand out. This attention requires focus and as a result requires mental energy, of which we have a limited store. The result is that can be limited by the amount of top down attention we can muster.

The relationship between the forms of attention is not a light switch but rather a dial. As we choose to focus in on a specific feature we end up dialing back the attentional attractiveness of the all other features.

Paying attention to specific features allows us to build a memory store of that features characteristics. The result is the ability to readily make decision about the quality of that feature with out applying much thought. Without focused attention it is not possible to store the details need to create the mental library.

When you focus you essentailly narrow your perspective. Most things outside the direct features of focus become blurry and soft. You memory account by that by filling in the surrounds with generic features from past events. This is why memories can seem full but details are only extractable from the features of focus.

## Chapter 2: Inside Out: Feeling Frame Focus

Strong emotions heighten our ability to focus. As a result emotional response are readily used to draw attention.

*Negativity Bias Theory* is the idea that we pay more attention to the bad thing then the good.

This come about as an evolutionary tactic to bring attention to potential threats. Yet in todays safe world the negativity we focus on is not often life threatening and more often then not is just a source of distraction.

Negative emotional responses tends to push our attention to a small very focused feature, the thing cause the emotional response. On the other end, positive emotional responses cause a widening of focus. This means that if you focus on the positive aspects of life you end up experiencing more of the world. Amazing!

The relationship between attention and cognition falls within three categories.
*Reactive* : biological responses to stimuli, more or less automatic functions
*Behavioral* : Learned patterns that can be done with little cognitive effort
*Reflective* : Higher level function that requires active attention and focus
For the most part the two lower level categories; reactive and behavioral can account for the majority of all the actions which we make in a day.

This ties in really well the 'Deep Work' idea, in that learning and creating require reflective attention and focus. Other mundane task can be learn and ran more or less through behavioral attention.

While attention does imply a conscious experience our action can be influences by features we take in but do not perceive. The thought it that these experience might be receive by the amygdala.


## Chapter 3
> Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side. Keep on the sunny side of life.
It'll help you day by day. It'll brighten all the way.
If you keep on the sunny side of life.

I felt that these lines describe the sentiment of this chapter well. We have the opportunity to alter our well being by changing what it is we spend time focusing on. There are a lot of good examples of this effect. An interesting one was that the elderly are often better able to find the good. This has to do with the understand that life is either mostly ahead of you or mostly behind.
Very valuable thought.

## Chapter 4
It is clear that focus effects out outlook on life. This chapter goes into the detail about how underlying character traits effect focus.
For instance if you classify yourself as an introvert or extravert will change who you place your focus.
This can be summed down to how much you are going to pay attention to your outward or inward environment. It was interesting that they "Knowledge workers" as a very introverted group. That fits well with the deep work idea.

Beyond personality type we're inclined to have either
*Respondent* : following a structure
*Experimental*: Pursuing the novel.
draw to focus. As with everything else, individuals fall on a spectrum between these extremes. Successful individuals have the ability to move back and forth through the perspective. Both as valuable and there are bad traits to each as well.

### extract
Just want to get this out.
I've been hooked on the systems thinking process for some time now but I still struggle with talking to people about it. Even talking to may self about it. I think this is partly due to not writing about it. I've read 3 books and multiple papers on the process but I don't have any real notes about it. Tisk tisk.
Anywhere there was something I read today in my systems view of life book that stood out to me.
Part of the process or the structure.
that is not a quote and frankly I'm not sure if the works process and structure are correct. But they seem to work.
In the cartisian method of thought which is still the dominate one. Everything is attempted to be view in isolation. Sysytems view of life has been going though and providing example of how other are starting to break from that method of thought and take on the whole is greater then the sum of its parts idea.
This idea of process and structure struck me as a core means of explaining that idea.
No feature stands alone, it is either a part of a structure or a part of a process. If it is a structure or a function depends mostly on what scale the feature is viewed at.
This does meld a bit with the form or function idea that is common speak, thought I not sure how closely tied that is to either the cartisian or systems philosophy.
Defining all features as either a structure or function removes the ability to speak of individuals. With out hte individual everything is a system. This seems like a core concept. We wrok with individuals because they are easier to measure the system they are a part of. This allows the emergent properties of systems to have a place even though they don't have a part of a structure. They are not a stand alone individual but a process of a stucture  or a process of a process. This train of thought inherently pushes attention outward toward the more complex features.
Process and Structure
Structure and process
That is all there is.

Hey geofellows,
I wanted to bring up a conference for you all. The International Association of Landscape Ecology is meeting in Fort Collins in April. The field of landscape ecology is mostly tied to understanding landscape change over space and time. It is what I want to do I just didn't know what to call it until I heard about this conference. The field itself is very methods focused and there is a lot of innovative work with spatial modeling, in particular network/connectivity analysis. An added bonus to it all that DEVELOP has a special session at the conference so if you wanted to present you have the opportunity.
Tim and I are the session officiators and it's invite only ;)

I know that you all get the chance to travel for a conference. I went to FOSS4G last year. While very informative it is much more a computer science crowd. Put another way, the attendants didn't much care about geospatial work being applied to the understanding of the landscape or the management of a ecological system. The IALE attendants will can about what you did but also why and how it was implemented.

Please check out two of the session description below.

If it feels like I'm being biased in my presentation of this information, I am. I think this conference is going to kick ass and I would love to see either or both of you in attendance.
Check it out for yourself. Call for presentations just opened.

(5) Multi-sensor Data Integration for Time Series Analysis of Land-change and Natural Resources
TYPE: Open Symposium

Contact: Kunwar Singh, North Carolina State University, kksingh@ncsu.edu

Co-Organizers: Lindsey S. Smart and Ross K. Meentemeyer, Center for Geospatial Analytics, Department of Forestry and Environmental Resources, North Carolina State University

Overview: In an era of ever-increasing global environmental change, phenomena like climate change, biological invasions and urbanization require scientists have ways to monitor these changes and their impacts on ecosystem form and function. The regional- to landscape-scales at which these phenomena occur, lend themselves to analysis using remote sensing technologies because of the generally broad spatial and temporal coverage of such technologies. Remote sensing capabilities are also rapidly advancing and becoming increasingly available to researchers, manager, and the public at even finer spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. This access to substantive amounts of data, along with the need to be able to monitor localities through time necessitate combining datasets with inconsistent data collection methods and accuracies. Thus, researchers are in need of novel methods and techniques to improve data compatibility and comparability so that accurate detection of changes or trends can be obtained. In this session, we explore remotely sensed time-series analysis of land-change phenomena, novel methods and approaches to reconcile data differences. This session particularly highlights research that uses a multi-sensor data integration approach for evaluating land change process and their impact on ecosystem services. The generalizability of these techniques with applications in different topical domains such as biological invasions, urban growth scenarios, magnitude of biomass change, ecosystem productivity, and coastal inundation. The goal of this session is to initiate a dialogue about innovative solutions for monitoring global environmental change by taking advantage of the increasing availability of remotely sensed technologies and datasets.

Theme/Topic: Remote Sensing, Time-series Analysis, and Global Environmental Change


(8) Species Distribution Models and Landscapes: Where Theory and Conservation Applications Collide
TYPE: Open Symposium

Contact: Thomas Edwards, U.S. Geological Survey / Utah State, t.edwards@usu.edu

Co-Organizers: Sam Cushman, USDA FSJanet Franklin, UC Riverside; Niklaus Zimmermann, WSL, Switzerland

Overview: The theoretical and conceptual bases for species distribution models and analogues (SDM) are well-grounded in published literature, but direct application to management and conservation of species on landscapes lags behind.  Reasons for this lack of application include, but are not limited to, perceptions of SDMs being "black-box" and overly complicated, illogical projections onto space, estimated (modelled) versus "known" locations, as well as other application concerns.  We propose an all-day, 4-pronged special session addressing 4 key elements necessary to enhance application of SDMs to landscape management and conservation.  These are: (i) theoretical underpinnings and recent advances of SDMs and their relationships to application; (ii) advances in modeling techniques affecting application; (iii) case studies in SDM application to landscape conservation and management; and (iv) integration of landscape SDMs into the world of decision-making.  The central aim of the session is to explore reasons why SDMs are not better incorporated into landscape conservation, and provide guidance for future developers of SDMs.  The theoretical session will focus on how different theoretical bases for modelling the "niche" affect subsequent modelling decisions and outcomes.  In the realm of statistical tools much work has been done, but often results in a "competing models" decision environment, making it difficult to apply any model to a conservation issue without potential conflict with other models. We present papers here that provide means to avoid such an environment, such as ensemble approaches.  Case studies selected for presentation will all need to address how the SDM is actually applied, and the concerns and criticisms applied to the SDM.  In short, simply presenting a SDM will not suffice.  Last, we will seek papers that explore reasons why SDMs are not employed by decision-makers, and seek solutions to the SDM process that may enhance their application to landscape conservation.

Theme/Topic: species distribution models; landscape conservation; modelling


Hi Catherine,
I had a few questions about the contract work for your group that was recently released. 
Are you looking for someone to work part time over an extended period or would a more concentrated effort be better?
I graduated with my masters in May of 2017. I believe the government definition of recent graduate is within 2 years of graduation. Would I still be able to qualify for the work?

I bring this up because I would appreciate the opportunity to work more closely with you and your group at the USGS. If given that opportunity I believe the job would integrate well with both the content and schedule of my current work at the USDA. My primary role now is performing species distribution models in R for crop wild relatives species (squash/peppers at this time). The position is based around a set number of 8 hour days. At 5 days a week the position would last May. My thought is that I could balance a part time role within both positions. I did this with DEVELOP and the USDA through the summer as a means of getting the projects up and running and stretching out the funding some.

Sorry for bombarding you with all the details, but it's something that I believe could work well depending on what you need for the position.

Thanks a bunch,
Dan
