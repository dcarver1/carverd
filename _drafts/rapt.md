# Introduction: Choosing the Focused Life


> I'll live the focused life, because it's the best kind there is.
page 14

This is the last line of the chapter but is also the primary theme of the book. Through focus we can define the quality of our life. This is supported by the fact that focus allows one to control what the mind is doing. Controlling the mind allow one to live in the present moment. Being in the present give us the agency to gain control over our actions. This agency allow us to build our own sense of well being.
Like most processes, it is easier said then done. The author was motivated by a major life effect of battling cancer to build her will of living a focused life. It seems her goal for this book is to prove that you don't need to be fighting for your life to take control and focus.  

# Chapter 1: Pay Attention: Your Life Depends on It

We can only concentrate an a small portion of the stimulus the world provides. As a result our lives are filled with features that are either *in focus* or *out of focus*

There are two mechanisms by which our attention can be captured.
**Bottom up attention** Stimulus that appeals to our base level want for novelty and uniqueness. This is a the core tactic of advertisement and is generally something we do not have control over. This type of attention takes like or no mental energy so we always have to deal with it.

**top down attention** the individual deciding what to focus on. The brain understand the character of the stimulus and makes that the feature that will most readily stand out. This attention requires focus and as a result requires mental energy, of which we have a limited store. The result is that can be limited by the amount of top down attention we can muster.

The relationship between the forms of attention is not a light switch but rather a dial. As we choose to focus in on a specific feature we end up dialing back the attentional attractiveness of the all other features.


### extract
Just want to get this out.
I've been hooked on the systems thinking process for some time now but I still struggle with talking to people about it. Even talking to may self about it. I think this is partly due to not writing about it. I've read 3 books and multiple papers on the process but I don't have any real notes about it. Tisk tisk. 
Anywhere there was something I read today in my systems view of life book that stood out to me.
Part of the process or the structure.
that is not a quote and frankly I'm not sure if the works process and structure are correct. But they seem to work.
In the cartisian method of thought which is still the dominate one. Everything is attempted to be view in isolation. Sysytems view of life has been going though and providing example of how other are starting to break from that method of thought and take on the whole is greater then the sum of its parts idea.
This idea of process and structure struck me as a core means of explaining that idea.
No feature stands alone, it is either a part of a structure or a part of a process. If it is a structure or a function depends mostly on what scale the feature is viewed at.
This does meld a bit with the form or function idea that is common speak, thought I not sure how closely tied that is to either the cartisian or systems philosophy.
Defining all features as either a structure or function removes the ability to speak of individuals. With out hte individual everything is a system. This seems like a core concept. We wrok with individuals because they are easier to measure the system they are a part of. This allows the emergent properties of systems to have a place even though they don't have a part of a structure. They are not a stand alone individual but a process of a stucture  or a process of a process. This train of thought inherently pushes attention outward toward the more complex features.
Process and Structure
Structure and process
That is all there is.
