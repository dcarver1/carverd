# Speaking to the public about future climate

This past week I was lucky enough to get to spend some time conversing with Dr. Steve Running. Professor emeritus at Montana State University in Missula. He was visting CSU as a part of a ditiguished ecologist seires that the Natural Resource Ecology Labortaty host. While there were many things that contributed to Dr. Running being asked to speak the one that stands out to most people is being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to the International Panel of Climate Change.
While his specific research was a large part of the conversation, what struck me the most was when he spoke about what he had learned about speaking to the general public regarding the future climate.
I wanted to take some time to summarize his ideas hear. ]

## Outline of the talk
Dr. Running spoke of spliting his takes into essentially three sections
1. Presenting the Data
2. Making it Relatable
3. What you can do

### Present Data
This is really where the scientist in all of use should feel comfortable. Bringing forth the information is what people expect of science and it is something that we really need to deliver. After 15 years of giving these public presentation Dr. Running feel on three main points to discuss.
**Image of the Atmoshpere from space**
It is difficult to understand just how thin the atmosphere is relative to the size of the world. The majority of all the molecules that encompass the atmosphere are found within the first ten miles. The distance from Fort Collins to Loveland. Showing people just how small it really is helps them grasp how we could actually pollute it. Plus it's just a beautiful image.   

 **Ocean as a Energy Sink**
 Where on a planet of water. The oceans are really the primary regulators of climate across the globe. Right now the ocean are working as buffers, absorbing much of the CO2 and energy that we are emitting. The oceans are big but they are not limitless.

 **Energy Balance Summary Image from the IPCC**
Serve Arrtenies was awarded the noble prize in 1903 for identifing the ability of atmosphere gases to retain heat emitted from the Earth surface. He was the person to first talk about the 'hot-house' effect of the atmoshpere. So the truth is the basic mechinism has been well known for along time. More CO2 in the atmoshpere means that less energy leaves the atmoshpere. Where things get tricky is explaining the complexity of all the interactions which can occur from the extra heat. This diagram allows you to showcase this system and engage in the topic as much as you need to.

### Making It Relatable
It is critical to bring the ideas back to the local level. Worldwide issues often catch people attention but they can fell to large and abstract to get them to engage with. Running's suggestion on this was to focus on actual historical weather data over time for the location that the talk is taking place in. He suggested generating historgrams of the temperate across a past time and a more current time. The reality is that the majorities of the histograms will overlap. All the change is occuring at the ends of the spectrum. There are more really hot days and less really cold day. While the change seems small when view like this it becomes more tangable. Those extreme events are often when limits ecological systems. Warm weather caps the types of tree that can grow in a location and those extreme cold weather often limits the preverance of certain insects. Tying this small change into the landscape that the audience experiences helps them understand what exectly a 2 degree increase in average temperature implies.

### What You Can Do
Dr Running stressed the importance of ending the tallk by providing some tangable actions. His favorite was the LED light bulb. In the scale of things it's a small step but if people start making small steps with the idea of climate change influencing their actions they are more likely to continue to be motived by the topic later on. Beyond the small step, Running spends time to actively push against the coal industry. In his home state of Montana the image painted by the coal industry is on of coal carrying the state into economic prosparity. The truth is coal account for a very low portion of the state economic. It's just that people never hear that so it's not part of their reality.
To me I felt that this may be a means of giving the concept climate change something to work against. It does not seem right to call it an enemy but the word opponent certainly works. Our relience on these industies and there persentent efforts to maintain thier power is inevertable changing our future and the world we have to live on. So it's really important to understand just what they are contributing and what they are holding back.

### Closing Out
All the work above was my own interpretation of Dr Running's work. In the short time I got to spend with him I developed a large amount of respect for his contribution to science and how he worked to engage and become a spokes person for science and the future of our planet. He started one of his talks by claiming that when he started science no one cared about what the public or journalist thought of thier work. Science was science. In the course of his career that clause has gone from the norm to a novolaty. The challenges facing our planet are close enough that we can afford the luxerly of science for science sake. We need to all find our own way in engaging outside of our our inner circles and share our work, knowledge, and ideas to all those we can.
