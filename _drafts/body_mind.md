# Notes on Body Mind Mastery

## Chapter 1: Understanding the Larger Game
This frames out the connection between training and all aspects of life.
It is nice because while this is written specific for athletes it is easy to connection on a personal and professional level right off the bat

four main ideas to focus
1. Non Resistance
four ways to approach forces of life
- surrender to them
- ignore them
- resist them
- use them to blend
The last of these is what is suggested. most of this centers around the idea of working with what you have. Making the most of a situation or idea

2. Accommodation
description of the learning processed
- development follows demand
- demand takes the form of progressive overload
- same movements outside of your comfort zone
- constant stream of little failures
- tolerance of the learning process
This is a good way to think of all processes. Match this with what fits into your way of being following the non resistance ideal

3. balance
Might the most difficult on to get right because it requires so much adaptation
Three things to balance
- physical
- emotional
- mental
The importance of each of these is that they flow up and down. Practice acceptance and be will to move with your bodies own needs and cycles

4.  Natural Order
Interesting idea that limits the importance of goal
> We can foresee the *direction* of our progress, but we can not foresee the *pace*

- focus on the process
- do not dwell on what could have been
- understand the rate of development and change
It's a hard one to summarize but the idea is that you do not need to focus on the things that are outside of your control or reach. Stay focus on what your training is currently pushing you too.

## Chapter 2 Awareness
Content is good just nothing out of what I expected.

## Chapter 3 Preparation
Nothing to groundbreaking in this section.
Really hitting on the point to focus on the basic skills and slowly build from that.
I feel like that is pretty reasonable think for coding, writing, disc golf even (low disc counts).
Great Quote

## Chapter 4 Mental Talent
This is where things really started connecting for me. Section headers are describe below
1. Limited Self-Concept
We set our own barriers within our preconceived perceptions of ourselves. These are often the hard barriers to break through.
Both underestimating and overestimating one's potential is harmful. The suggested goal is to simple let it happen with as little though of what it can or can not be. This allows your body and emotional capacities to set the limits on what you can do.
2. Fear Of Failure
We all feel this, rather strongly at some points. The truth of the matter is that while failure hurts it is only a negative thing if you don't learn from it. IF you develop the mindset of trying and learning from those attempts then you can start moving fear and the stress it puts into your body behind.
3. Destructive Self-Criticism
We are our own hardest critic. That Criticism is important but it must be balanced adnd constructive. It's not that your messing everything up it's that your identifying opportunities to improve.
4. One-Pointed Attention
This is a bid so focus in the everyday. Being able to block out the noise and make the task at hand the one task that matters. To me this is an impressive state and a difficult one to move in to. Try to practice focus with breathing exercises and build the progression naturally.

## Chapter 5 Emotional Talent
This was not groundbreaking in it's ideals but still great to see it be bring into attention. Major points are listed below

1. Breaking the Circuit of Tension
You mental ability will push tension onto your body. You need to understand how this tension is being applied and work around it.

2. Breath and Feeling
Knowing how your body react to breath is it no surprise that you can also use breath as a tool for calming the mind and focusing on the feeling of your body.

3. Expanding awareness
Praticing to feel for tension in your body pressure in location and or just connecting more to the place you are currently in allow  a great sense of focus later on.

## Chapter 6 Physical Talent
The author makes a big point of using the body as a means of assessing the development of the emotional and mental self. this is because the body visible changes and it is where all our sensations are felt. The big message for the majority of the chapter is the role of consistency and focus. There is a lot of attention put into practicing for form. The negative effect of learning poor technique is define by the bodies general resistance to change. The ideal of a coach is brought up a lot as someone who can hone in the focus of the technique while learning.

- Relaxation: the master key to physical talent
I love this notion and it's brought up a bunch in this chapter. This type of relaxation is more significant then the taking a rest or some deep breaths. It's about finding a base level of tension in your body to realize when that tension is building. This is the achieved by the vacation that we all talk about but rarely do.

- The four Ss of Physical Talent
1. Strength
Gets at the idea of effective strength that comes from the ability to hold tension and relaxation within the muscle. this allows for the maximum difference and that is were effective strength comes from . He speak about cats and how relaxed their muscle are at rest. They suggest trying to do pushup while relax and tense to notice the difference in strength and try to grew from it.
2. Suppleness
The practice of non resistance. This comes from being able to release chronic tension  and replace the habits that promoted the tension with those that dont.
The sections are
- awareness of Tension
- conscious relaxation
- stretching
3. Sensitivity
This is summed up by the idea of balance and kinesthetic awareness. Or the coordination of the body and mind. Practicing these skills helps you group your sense of awareness and ability to pay attention. Sensitivity is very closely related to relaxation.
4. Stamina
The ability to work over a period of time. This is the end result of training. It is important to push your stamina past the level that you need to perform at so your not maxing out you body during the event.

## Chapter 7 Tools for training
There was some interesting content in here about the history of fitness and where sports should end up. The big message was that most sports do not provide the balance needed to be healthy so it's best to incorporate multiple types. Also the focus needs to be on what you get out of the activity. As a result of this sports that incorporate a guided focus or meditative component have been becoming more successful and sought after.
- awareness and practice
repetition is not as important as attention. You need to actively think about what your doing and reflect on how it went. This is the best way to not fall into incorrect pathways.
- Stages of practice
there is a natural order to learning that should be followed. Practice some come in consistent waves and be limited at the start of learning
recommendation is to practice in sets of three then stop and reflect.  
1. overcompensation
we become stuck in ruiten and comfort. Over compensating for a process helps find the upper boundary of the process and learn how to work within it.
2. ideomotor action and mental practice
This is the idea that visuallizing the process can help you body understand how to perform the movements in real life. This is great because you can do it while sitting or being tired or lying down. It opens the time you can commit to a process.
3. Slow Motion Practice
this seems really like an attention exercise. Moving slowly makes it easier to follow the form and movement of the motion and understand what is causeing what. Where is tension held how does a adjust effect the process.
4. Begining and End End Method.
Because it is not possible to practice all action in slow motion you can focus on a begining and end position. The logic is that if you start and finsih correctly the form inbetween will develop consistently
5. Part whole pratice.
split up you work into smaller processes to understand how that all come together. This can be helpful in identifying where a process is causing issues.
6. Imitation
this is the ultimate way to learn. Watching an expect and trying to match there form. It's how childern learn for the most part

## Chapter 8: Competition and Cooperation
This really start to get at the idea that the experience and the training should be the goal of any practice. Winning is good but fleeting. Cooperation makes you away of the other ideas and techniques involved and increases you ability to improve.
- the competitive mind
while winning is a strong motivator the best athletes are always trying to improving upon their own game and understanding look at your opponent as a teach then the stress and tension that come form competition can be better dealt with.
- overload and cutback
Train harder then what you need when your competing. More repetition more weight a faster pace. Cutback before the event to recover. This way you feel that you are going easy on the day of the performance.
- preparing emotions and attitudes
nervousness increasing your physically preparedness and energy. If you feeling nervous use that energy by actively engaging in something.
- mental game.
The ultimate goal of training is that when you need to pull on the training you can do it with a calm and focused mind. The actions are comfortable and easy and your judgement is clear. This can be achieved by bringing that same set of focus to your practice.

## Chapter 9: The evolution of athletics
I spoke about most of this already out of turn as the intro for chapter 7. The core idea is that sports should promote well being. That comes from balance intention. There is a section about the again athlete which is important. You current physical state needs to be a reflection of your current training not what you have done in the past. That distinction is a challenging one

## chapter 10 : Mastering the moving experience
prologue to sum up the work.
Balance of body mind and emotion
focus on the process not the prize
relaxation and concentration build ability
teach the body how to perform and let it do it.

Not from the book but very fitting.
