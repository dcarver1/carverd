# Notes on Body Mind Mastery

## Chapter 1: Understanding the Larger Game
This frames out the connection between training and all aspects of life.
It is nice because while this is writen specific for athletes it is easy to connection on a personal and professional level right off the bat

four main ideas to focus
1. Non Resistance
four ways to approach forces of life
- surrender to them
- ignore them
- resist them
- use them to blend
The last of these is what is suggested. most of this centers around the idea of working with what you have. Making the most of a situtation or idea

2. Accommodation
description of the learning processed
- development follows demand
- demand takes the form of progressive overload
- same movements outside of your comfort zone
- constant stream of little failures
- tolerance of the learning process
This is a good way to think of all processes. Match this with what fits into your way of being following the non resistance ideal

3. balance
Might the most difficult on to get right because it requires so much adaptation
Three things to balance
- physical
- emotional
- mental
The importance of each of these is that they flow up and down. Practice acceptance and be will to move with your bodies own needs and cycles

4.  Natural Order
Interesting idea that limits the importance of goal
> We can foresee the *direction* of our progress, but we can not foresee the *pace*

- focus on the process
- do not dwell on what could have been
- understand the rate of development and change
It's a hard one to summarize but the idea is that you do not need to focus on the thing that are outside of your control or reach. Stay focus on what your training is currently pushing you too.

## Chapter 2 Awareness
Content is good just nothing out of what I expected.

## Chapter 3 Preparation
Nothing to groundbreaking in this section.
Really hitting on the point to focus on the basic skills and slowly build from that.
I feel like that is pretty reasonable think for coding, writing, disc golf even (low disc counts).

## Chapter 4 Mental Talent
This is where things really started connecting for me. Section headers are describe below
1. Limited Self-Concept
We set our own barriers within our preconceived perceptions of ourselves. These are often the hard barriers to break through.
Both underestimating and overestimating one's potential is harmful. The suggested goal is to simple let it happen with as little though of what it can or can not be. This allows your body and emotional capacities to set the limits on what you can do.
2. Fear Of Failure
We all feel this, rather strongly at some points. The truth of the matter is that while failure hurts it is only a negative thing if you don't learn from it. IF you develop the mindset of trying and learning from those attempts then you can start moving fear and the stress it puts into your body behind.
3. Destructive Self-Criticism
We are our own hardest critic. That Criticism is important but it must be balanced adnd constructive. It's not that your messing everything up it's that your identifying opportunities to improve.
4. One-Pointed Attention
This is a bid so focus in the everyday. Being able to block out the noise and make the task at hand the one task that matters. To me this is an impressive state and a difficult one to move in to. Try to practice focus with breathing exercises and build the progression naturally.
