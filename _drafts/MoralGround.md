# Moral Ground: Ethical Action For A Planet In Peril
## Editors: Kathleen Dean Moore and Michael P. Nelson

This book was published in 2010. At that point the editors as well as the authors all perceived that human activities were altering the well being of the planet. Our individual and societal well being is inexplicitly tied to the well being of the planet. Therefore, action is needed and must be done for moral reasons to preserve what we are lucky enough to have.
> This book is a call to that moral affirmation. It is a call to people to honor their moral responsibility to the future to strive to avert the worst consequences of the environmental emergencies and leave a world as rich in life and possibility as the world we line in.

*Introduction: XVI*

## *Do we have a moral obligation to take action to protect the future of a planet in peril?*
## **Yes, for the survival of humankind.**

### The Limits of Growth
*James Gustave Speth*
A very powerfully written piece about the need for post-growth society. Claims that environmental movement need to work with the reform politics and those advocates for social injustice to have any ability to combat the current political economy of capitalism.
> But today's environmental reality is linked powerfully with other realities, including growing social inequality and neglect and the erosion of democratic governance and popular control. So we must now mobilize our spiritual and political resources of transformative change on all three fronts. We as all communities of shared fate. We will rise or fall together.

### The Danger of Human Exceptionalism
*David Quinn*
Human Exceptionalism was a theory put forth by Thomas Malthus stating that there human continue to increase in population size regardless of the increase in food resources. Only humans do this, hence the exception. Quinn puts forth the idea that capping food production is a mechanism of restricting population growth. The big piece here is that hunger is a poverty issue not a food issue. We've continued to increase food production yet hunger does not decrease proportionally. Quinn makes the example of human as biomass, and that our biomass has double in the past 50 years. That biomass comes from other living organism because that is the only thing it can come from. That is the pressure that is being put on ecological systems.
