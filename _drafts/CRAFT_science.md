# C.R.A.F.T science communication
Creative (How)
Relevant (How)
Audience (Who)
Format (What)
Take home message (why)

Dr. Meena Balgopal is a professor of Biology at Colorado State University. I attend a workshop of hers about crafting science communication. It was excellent, in large part because Dr. Balgopal is a facilitator. It was a refreshing thing to see after so many one sided lecturers. Dr. Balgopal engaged and interacted with the audience. Again, let me just say. Awesome.

Interestingly, the title for her talk was suggested by a colleague. Dr. Balgopal, creativity develop the acronym of CRAFT. Which she presented as the frame work for building your science story. We cover the specifics of the CRAFT process below. First we start with some basics about stories.
For instance all stories contain elements of

- events
- characters
- conflict/resolution
- causality/agency

It's important to think about these elements because they all can be used to evoke emotional responses from the reader. Emotions are what keeps people engaged, specifically if your audience is not directly studying the same thing you are. Emotions are emergent properties of good stories.
Dr. Balgopal suggest that as scientists we can use Socio-Scientific Issues(SSI) to bring out emotions in our audience. SSI are complex problems with no distinct answers. Yet scientific knowledge is an important part of understanding the problem. Maybe the two most extensively discussed SSIs are climate change and genetic engineering of crops. Yet examples of SSIs are plentiful in every field. It would seem that scientist are often hesitant to speak about these issue in contexts of their own work because of the polarizing power of these topics. Yet, it's that power that will keep people engaged in your work. If we want a story we should speak to a hot button issue because it will envoke an emotional response.

Dr. Balgopal suggests that we base our stories in the narrative framework as much as we can. This is usually possible with intention and a little extra effort. The tools she suggested to help develop the narrative is the use of the dramatic structure( intro, rising action, climax, resolution). This is important because the audience is often uncomfortable with conflict and they want to continue to engage to find the resolution.

This is a bit more of a complicated version of the idea just incase your really looking to push the narrative. The basic idea is that when framing the story your tie elements of your work to each component .

Another way to start thinking about the spinning of a narrative is by incorporating one of the 7 primary stories themes defined by Booker C, 2006. The reason behind this is that individuals will recognize the plot and that triggers the want for resolution. Also, it's easy to think of examples of all these elements from other stories you have read. The quest and overcoming the mosters(stanger comes to town) are probably the two more common ones in science writing. Most applied research is goal define and really set on addressing a known issues, so it connects well with these frames. 

1) Overcoming the Monster;
2) Rags to Riches;
3) The Quest;
4) Voyage and Return;
5) Comedy;
6) Tragedy; and
7) Rebirth.

Lastly looking into frame theory to set your story into a larger cultural concern
- social progress
- economic development
- moral or ethical right
- scientific uncertainty
- Pandora's box
- public accountability
- middle way
- conflict strategy

Yet probably the most important piece of them all is that the take home message is clear.


I'm providing an example of how I'm integrating these suggestion into a presentation about crop wild relatives for an upcoming GIS day presentation.

1. Set the message
I'm starting with the **Take home message** because I think it's the most important element to get right.
 > The future of our food is tied to the conservation of the crop wild relative, and the conservation of those species in an inherently spatial question.

 2. Set the frame of the story
I'm going to use **scientific uncertainty** to frame the need for GIS users to start thinking about CWR
I'm pushing my comfort zone a bit by framing the importance of CWR with **Moral Right** and **middle way**

It is easy to tie in the economic process agruement but I'm just starting to belive that that frame is having some dire consequences on or future. Im staying away from it for now.
- Scientific uncertainty: CWR have been evolving in varied ecological conditions across the landscape. The different environmental conditions effect the genes that expressed with that population. Yet there are some really big questions about how those characteristics change over space. Until we know that there is no good way of knowing whats out there.

- Moral Right: CWR hold a genetic diversity that has tangetable benifits to our food staple. We know that genetic diversity is some thing that once gone does we can not get back. By fighting for the presevation of the landscape that these CWR live within we can build awareness around the importance of biodiversity.
- middle ground: There is a lot of polarization that occurs around the notion of genetic modification. Because CWR are closely related to modern crop there is potential for merge the qualities of the plants with traditional breeding methods.

 So far all this was pretty easy. Not far from how I would with presentation in general. The tricky part for me is making it a story.

 3. Story theme
 I'm going to give the **Voyage and Return** story a shot here. I like the idea of framing the plant as a character. Showing it as changing and growing from what it was over the course of time and coming back to it's origin as a means of continuing forward. I think rather then the crop being a primary it makes more sense that sciencist and framers play a role in the development.

If we look at the ways to build emotional ties
- events
  - domestication
  - specialization
  - climate change
  - back to the dependents
- characters
    - iconic crop
    - framer
    - crop scientist
    - spatial scientist
- conflict/resolution
  - climate change and over specialization
  - lack of genetic variability  
  - understand the relationship between spatial variability and genetic diversity provides directs on where to look for the needed traits.
- causality/agency
  - scientist looking for solutions outside of there own field ?
  - think about this one some.


4. Checking back with CRAFT.
If we take a look at the process so far we've address quite a few of the aspects of CRAFT.

### Audience
Audience is a group ranging from professionals to students who are interested in GIS and probably know very little about CWRs. I know this from knowing the venue that I'm presenting at.
### Take home message
Take home message is loud and clear. There is a challenge and geospatial knowledge is needed.
### Format
This will be presentation but I'm building it around a story of a well know crop. I'm framing in around the SSI of genetic modification and suggesting a right and less dramatic alternative to the current process.

### Relevancy
This is really about the future of food and how folks in this audience can help. At the end I tie there skills to part of the solution.

### Creative
There is a lot of room for growth in this area but it's a start. As the presentation comes together I think there will be a lot of opportunity to make it something more creative. Specifically showing visualizations of the problem at hand.

I wrote this up over two 1 hour sessions. While there still is a lot of work to do I like what i have framed out. Not it's a matter of filling out the form. It was important to me to spend the extra time planning this presentation because it is my first time presenting about this topic. I think with something more familiar CRAFTing the story would com together quicker.
