# C.R.A.F.T science communication
Creative (How)
Relevant (How)
Audience (Who)
Format (What)
Take home message (why)

Dr. Meena Balgopal is a professor of Biology at Colorado State University. I attend a workshop of hers about crafting science communication. It was excellent, in large part because Meena is a facilitator. It was a refreshing thing to see after some many lecturers. Someone who engaged and interacted with the audience. Again, let me just say. Awesome.

Interestingly, the title for her talk was suggested by a colleague. Meena, took the creativity and time to develop the acronym of CRAFT. Which she presented as the frame work for building your science story. Some import ideas was that all stories contain elements of
- events
- characters
- conflict/resolution
- causality/agency
It's important to think about these elements because they all can be used to evoke emotional responses from the reader. Emotions are keep for engaging people, specifically those that are not directly studying the same thing you are. Emotions are emergent properties of stories.
Meena suggest that as scientist we can we Socio-Scientific Issues to bring out emotions in our audience. SSI are complex problems with no distinct answers. Yet scientific knowledge is an important part of understanding the problem. Maybe the two most extensively discussed SSI are climate change and genetic engineering of crops. Yet example of those are plentiful in every field. It would seem that scientist are often hesitant to speak about these issue in contexts of their own work because of the polarizing power of these topics. Yet, it's that power that will keep people engaged in your work.

Meena suggest that we base our stories in the narrative framework as much as we can. This is usually possible with intention and extra effort. The tools she suggested to help is the use of dramatic structure( intro, rising action, climax, resolution). This is important because the audience is often uncomfortable with conflict and they want to continue to engage to find the resolution. *find picture*
The incorporation of the 7primary stories themes defined by Booker C, 2006.

1) Overcoming the Monster;
2) Rags to Riches;
3) The Quest;
4) Voyage and Return;
5) Comedy;
6) Tragedy; and
7) Rebirth.

Lastly looking into frame theory to set your story into a larger cultural concern
- social progress
- economic development
- moral or ethical right
- scientific uncertainty
- Pandora's box
- public accountability
- middle way
- conflict strategy

Yet probably the most imporant peice of them all is that the take home message is clear.


I'm providing an example of how I'm integrating these suggestion into a presentation about crop wild relatives for an upcoming GIS day presentation.

1. Set the message
I'm starting with the **Take home message** because I think it's the most important element to get right.
 > The future of our food is tied to the conservation of the crop wild relative, and the conservation of those species in an inherently spatial question.

 2. Set the frame of the story
