## Research Experience
### USDA Agricultural Research Service

I currently, have five articles of which I am a co-author under review. Four of these are on species distribution modeling of crop wild relatives, and one is an evaluation of the relationship between the USDA ARS and the BLM Seeds of Success program.

Crop wild relatives of chile pepper (Capsicum L.): Distributions, conservation status, and implications for adaptations to abiotic stresses" is presently being given full consideration for publication in Diversity and Distributions.

Crop wild relatives of pumpkins, squashes, and gourds (Cucurbita L.): Distributions, conservation status, and abiotic stress tolerance potential, is submitted to Plants, People, Planet.

Collecting Native Seed for Restoration: Collateral Benefits to Agricultural Crop Improvement, Research and Education, is presently being considered for publication in Crop Science.

Distributions and conservation status of carrot (Daucus L.) wild relatives in Tunisia: A case study in the Western Mediterranean basin, is presently being considered for publication in Crop Science.

Research gaps and challenges in the conservation and exploitation of North American wild lettuce (Lactuca L.) germplasm, is presently being considered for publication in Crop Science.

### NASA DEVELOP

May 2017 - September 2018

**Minnesota and Texas Agriculture**

*In progress*

> Worked with the USDA Plant and Animal Genetic Resource Preservation group to predict the extent and temporal variability of wild rice in Minnesota and Texas.

**Colorado River Basin Water Resources II**

[Project Details](https://develop.larc.nasa.gov/2017/fall/ColoradoRiverBasinWaterII.html)

> Used NASA Earth Observations to predict Russian Olive presence and estimate Evapotranspiration rates of riparian vegetation along the San Juan River in New Mexico and Colorado.

 **Colorado River Basin Water Resources I**

[Project Detials](https://develop.larc.nasa.gov/2017/summer/ColoradoRiverBasinWater.html)

> Used NASA Earth Observations to predict Tamarisk presence and percent cover along a stretch of the Colorado, Green, and Dolores river in Utah and Colorado.

### Thesis Research

**Accessing the representational accuracy of GlobeLand30's classification of Mexico's Forest.**

Chair: Dr. Rafael Moreno

Committee: Dr Galen Maclaurian, Dr. Peter Athamathem, Dr. Jaun Manuel Torres Rojo

> This work represents a validation of a remote sensing derived global land cover dataset using a ground verified series of forest inventory sites. Through this process, I have done extensive research on the development and limitations of remote sensing derive land cover maps, validation methodology for land cover maps, and potential sources of errors in both the imagery and the validation sets. Overall it is a very detail examination of how well a Landsat
product can represent a land cover.

### Soil  and Geoarchaeology research

**Upper Rio Grande Basin**

> Worked with Dr. Jared Beeton on a soils based geoarchaeological investigation of 2nd and 3rd order tributaries of the Rio Grande River in the Upper Rio Grande Basin. Through this work, I have made multiple public presentations, learned and exercised field-based scientific research, proposed and obtained funding for 14C dating of soil organic matter. Geomorphic landforms were field mapped using GPS, digitized, and expanded on based on the interpretation of high resolution remotely sensed data.

**Mammoth Site Excavation**

> During 2011 I worked under Dr. Jared Beeton, and The Denver Museum of Natural Science in the excavation and geomorphic investigation of mammoth remains found within the San Luis Valley. I ran laboratory analysis on the soils and sediment collected from the site.

## Relevant Couse Work and Projects

### Personal Project: Disc Golf Mapping

> I have developed an automated methodology that takes a lidar point cloud and GPS data and produces an accurate representation disc golf course as a map. The lidar processing is down within the arcpy module, and GPS points are field collected.
