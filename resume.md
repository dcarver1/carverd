## Research Experience
### NASA DEVELOP

May 2017 - Present

**Minnisota and Texas Agriculture**

*In progress*

> Worked with the USDA Plant and Animal Genetic Resource Preservation group to predict the extent and temporal variability of wild rice in Minnesota and Texas.

**Colorado River Basin Water Resources II**

[Project Details](https://develop.larc.nasa.gov/2017/fall/ColoradoRiverBasinWaterII.html)

> Used NASA Earth Observations to predict Russian Olive presence and estimate Evapotranspiration rates of riparian vegetation along the San Juan River in New Mexico and Colorado.

 **Colorado River Basin Water Resources I**

[Project Detials](https://develop.larc.nasa.gov/2017/summer/ColoradoRiverBasinWater.html)

> Used NASA Earth Observations to predict Tamarisk presence and percent cover along a stretch of the Colorado, Green, and Dolores river in Utah and Colorado.

### Thesis Research

**Accessing the representational accuracy of GlobeLand30's classification of Mexico's Forest.**

Chair: Dr. Rafael Moreno

Committee: Dr Galen Maclaurian, Dr. Peter Athamathem, Dr. Jaun Manuel Torres Rojo

> This work represent a validation of a remote sensing derived global land cover dataset. This is done by using a ground verified series of forest inventory sites. Through this process I have done extensive research on the development and limitations of remote sensing derive land cover maps, validation methodology for land cover maps, and potential sources of errors in both the imagery and the validation sets. Overall it is a very detail examination of how well a landsat
product can represent a land cover.

### Soil Geomorphology and Geoarcheology research

**Upper Rio Grande Basin**

> Worked with Dr. Jared Beeton on a soils based geoarchaeological investigation of 2nd and 3rd order tributaries of the Rio Grande River in the Upper Rio Grande Basin. Through this work I have made multiple public presentations, learned and exercised field based scientific research, proposed and was granted funding for 14C dating of soil organic matter. Geomorphic landforms were field mapped using GPS, digitized, and expanded on based on the interpretation if high resolution remotely sensed data.

**Mammoth Site Excavation**

> During 2011 I worked under Dr. Jared Beeton and The Denver Museum of Natural Science in the excavation and geomorphic investigation of mammoth remains found within the San Luis Valley. I ran laboratory analysis on the soils and sediment collected from the site.

## Relevant Couse Work and Projects

### Personal Project: Disc Golf Mapping

> I have developed an automated methodology that takes a lidar point cloud and gps data and produces an accurate representation disc golf course as a map. The lidar processing is down within the arcpy module and GPS points are field collected. This was done to fill a gap a community I actively participate in.
