I've never have had much luck reading anthologies. While there is a theme through the book, the lack of central and unifying direction means I often leave them half finish or half started. At the same time, where else can you get such a collection of thoughts or exposure to the new works of authors. My solution, take the time to write about each piece that I read. I believe that the act of adding my own thoughts and reactions will tie the work together in a way that keeps me motivated.


# Moral Ground: Ethical Action For A Planet In Peril
## Editors: Kathleen Dean Moore and Michael P. Nelson

This book was published in 2010. At that point the editors as well as the authors all perceived that human activities were altering the well being of the planet. Our individual and societal well being is inexplicitly tied to the well being of the planet. Therefore, action is needed and must be done for moral reasons to preserve what we are lucky enough to have.
> This book is a call to that moral affirmation. It is a call to people to honor their moral responsibility to the future to strive to avert the worst consequences of the environmental emergencies and leave a world as rich in life and possibility as the world we line in.

*Introduction: XVI*

## *Do we have a moral obligation to take action to protect the future of a planet in peril?*
## **Yes, for the survival of humankind.**

### The Limits of Growth
*James Gustave Speth*
A very powerfully written piece about the need for post-growth society. Claims that the environmental movement needs to work with reform politics and those advocates for social injustice to have any ability to combat the current political economy of capitalism.
> But today's environmental reality is linked powerfully with other realities, including growing social inequality and neglect and the erosion of democratic governance and popular control. So we must now mobilize our spiritual and political resources of transformative change on all three fronts. We as all communities of shared fate. We will rise or fall together.


### The Danger of Human Exceptionalism
*David Quinn*
Human Exceptionalism was a theory put forth by Thomas Malthus stating that there human continue to increase in population size regardless of the increase in food resources. Only humans do this, hence the exception. Quinn puts forth the idea that capping food production is a mechanism of restricting population growth. The big piece here is that hunger is a poverty issue not a food issue. We've continued to increase food production yet hunger does not decrease proportionally. Quinn makes the example of human as biomass, and that our biomass has double in the past 50 years. That biomass comes from other living organism because that is the only thing it can come from. That is the pressure that is being put on ecological systems.

### A Question of Our Own Survival
*The Dalai Lama*
A very approachable piece about the importance of the Earth from the Buddhist perspective, kind of. That's not really the best way to put it, that is it's not really limited to the Buddhist experience it's just that is what the author frames it through. Great messages about the important of caring, compassion and understanding. Speak to the importance of thinking of karma and the danger of following only selfish gains.
> With the ever-growing impacts of science on our lives, religion and spirituality have a greater role to play in reminding us of our humanity. There is not contradiction between the two. Each gives us valuable insights into the other. Both science and the teachings of the Buddha tell us of the fundamental unity of all things.

### The Fate of Creation Is the Fate of humanity
*E.O.Wilson*
A shorter essay that highlights the two primary ways in which human society is dependent upon the well being of the ecological system of the Earth. I found a specific paragraph which highlight how so many choose to remain ignorant of the damages cause we very impactful.
> There seems no better way to explain why so many  smart people remain passive while the precious remnants of the natural world disappear.

### The Inuit Right to Culture Based on Ice and Snow
*Sheila Watt-Cloutier*
This is a very unique perspective, given that it is coming from someone in culture that is still very much connected to the landscape as a food source. I write that and I realize how silly that sounds. We're all still very much connected to the landscape as a food source. For most of us that connection is abstracted through societal structure, for the Inuit, it's a very direct connection. The most important notion from this writing was that we need to make a climate change a human's right issue not a economic, political, or technical issue. In pushing a purely economically focused society we are eliminating the Inuit's ability to maintain their culture. Sheila goes on to claim that the reason we are having this issue in the first place is due to a lack of connection.
> I always ask the global community, is it not to reestablish that connection that we are all here trying to deal with this issue? Is it not because people have lost that connection between themselves and their neighbors, between their actions and the environment, that we are debating this issue of climate change in the first place?  

### The Future I Want for My Daughters
*Barack Obama*
This is very short piece that is built on top a very good preexisting quotes. I have to admit, it felt very good to read someone of past political standing making some strong statements about our moral obligation to make the world a better place for the future. In the 2 page essay it hits on many of the primary challenges facing the (country, world, or future I'm finding it very hard to tie theses issues to a singular entity) future. Entrenched political system based on extractive industries, the challenge of limiting ourselves now for something in the future, and the reality that the climatic variability will change how we live. We don't want to hear about any of these things. As if ignoring the problem will somehow make it go away...

> And so we've got this obligation to them, which means that we've got to make some uncomfortable choices. And potentially, religious faith and the science of global warming converge precisely because it's going to be hard to deal with. We have to find resources in ourselves that allow us to make those sacrifices where we say, you know what? We're not going to leave it to the next generation. We're not going to wait.
