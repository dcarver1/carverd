## 7 primary story themes

1) Overcoming the Monster;
2) Rags to Riches;
3) The Quest;
4) Voyage and Return;
5) Comedy;
6) Tragedy; and
7) Rebirth.

## Frame Theory: how to frame your conflict

- social progress
- economic development
- moral or ethical right
- scientific uncertainty
- Pandora's box
- public accountability
- middle way
- conflict strategy


1. Set the message
 - define a clear and distinct **take home message**

 2. Set the frame of the story
- decide on one or two Frames from which you will describe your narrative. What emotional process are you trying to appeal to.

 3. Story theme
- The theme describe the progress of the narrative. Overcoming the monster is a common one in science because the problem can be set as the monster.  

4. Building emotional ties  
- events
  - What are the actions that take place, where are there, who is involved
- characters
  - What people are connected, is the feature your studying a character
- conflict/resolution
  -  try to tie this to a [Socio-Scientific Issues(SSI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socio-scientific_issues) because it's likely the audience has a perspective on it and therefore has
- causality/agency
  - How can the characters or the audience play a role in the process.

4. Checking back with CRAFT.
If we take a look at the process so far we've address quite a few of the aspects of CRAFT.

### Audience
Audience is a group ranging from professionals to students who are interested in GIS and probably know very little about CWRs. I know this from knowing the venue that I'm presenting at.
### Take home message
Take home message is loud and clear. There is a challenge and geospatial knowledge is needed.
### Format
This will be presentation but I'm building it around a story of a well know crop. I'm framing in around the SSI of genetic modification and suggesting a right and less dramatic alternative to the current process.

### Relevancy
This is really about the future of food and how folks in this audience can help. At the end I tie there skills to part of the solution.

### Creative
There is a lot of room for growth in this area but it's a start. As the presentation comes together I think there will be a lot of opportunity to make it something more creative. Specifically showing visualizations of the problem at hand.
