# Character Typing, is it Important?
No one really wants to be put in a box. It's easy to get defensive if someone were to classify you, real or not. So it makes bit a sence to me that using some form of character tyoeing such as a Myers Breggs test in not often meet with lots of enthusiam.
 On a personal level it doesn't feel like it adds all that much.

The test are ofter force to make generalized statements that don't really apply across all settings.

Where these assessments shine is when building and thinking about teams. The truth of the matter teams can be more productive and effective then individuals working alone. Another example of the sum being greater then the whole of the parts. Yet, teams require more work to maintain and develop relative to individual projects. When we have the option to build teams or even as we start to work with a new team, taking the time to introduce the individuals with a structured method is a great way of pointed the ship in the right direction.

I've engaged in organization that have used character typing in various forms and the one that has really stood out to me is the CLifton Strength Finder. What's interesting about it is that it focuses on identifying what your good. When building teams that's probably the most important thing to know. Identifying your strengths and being able to speak to them will help you find your role in the group and ensure that the tasks are being addres efficently.


Below is my interpretation of the results I received from the Clifton StrengthFinder2.0 assessment. In my experience, the value of this type of personal assessment comes from your interpretation of the results and how you share that information with other. I do believe that if these processes initiate conversations between co workers then they can add greatly to the effectiveness of work groups. Yet, the simple output of these assessments, in this case a  list of what your strengths are, does little to inspire conversations with others.  So I took the time make something that is informative and visually engaging. This assessment lives in my work places as a reminder to myself and as a tool for starting a conversation with my co workers about  what we can bring to the table.
