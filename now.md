Gosh, March was nuts...

The virus, I affectionally call, it who must not be named, has throw a serious bolt in the gears of the world. The uncertainty and rapidness in which all levels of governance follow suit was and still is astounding. It's a serious issue without a doubt. One I'm trying to write about to get grips on. I guess to summarize my thoughts I'm growing a beard for the millions of people who have given up their access to education and those who lost their ability to maintain a business, pursue meaningful work, or support themselves and those they care about.

Other news, I'm working with the geospatial centroid at Colorado State University as the technical manager for the program. It's a new role so we are still working our what exactly it entails. It's a great feeling and I'm loving the work.
