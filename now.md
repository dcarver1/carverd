Right now I am focused on quantifying the conservation status of 650 species in North America. These species are wild relatives of agricultural crop and are found in the natural environment. This means I'm spending a lot of time troubleshooting R code. I'm also learning how to run the modeling in a distributive computing environment.

To balance this technical tasks I'm writing more. Compiling book reviews from 2019. Doing a fair bit of personal reflection through text and I attempt to find the next job opportunity that will be the best.

I'm also starting a sculpture art project using metal and rock. It's good break from the screen
