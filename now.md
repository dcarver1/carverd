Summer is here!

For not doing all that much do to social distancing factors, I feel like a lot has been going on. I'm trying to get situated into two new positions, which is a bit more challenging then I expected. I want to point a finger at the all remote workplace structure but that's not the whole of it.

Current projects
- finalizing gap analysis R library and paper
- edits for CWR of USA paper ~ fairly positive review from PNAS which is great
- co facilitating a software carpentry training on R
- trying to get my head around GRIN Global, or at least a piece of it.
- remote gardening, lol yes, we at least part time :)
