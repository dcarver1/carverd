I am wrapping up the big crop wild relative conservation status assessment for the 650 species of North America. Within the week should be evaluating this work and writing up results/conclusion for the paper. This process should help guide future crop wild relative conservation efforts written about [here.](https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/cs/articles/59/6/2302)

I've been putting a lot of time into creating an R library so others can perform the gap analysis method that my co-workers and I have been using over the past few years. It has been a big learning experience for me and is changing how I think about the writing code.  

[Roam](Roamresearch.com) is a note-taking system that uses a graph database rather than a hierarchical organization structure for files. It is lovely and is becoming my go-to source for organization, and I'm slowly converting the goal structure/task management I used in notion.so into roam. It's not perfect, but the graph database structure is much more representative of how we think, so I'm committing to the change.
