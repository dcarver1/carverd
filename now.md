I spent some time reworking my github page which was fun. I'm taking some time to learn more about shiny R applications as they will be a part of our standard products at the centroid in the near future.
Work on the covid night lights project is continuing. I've developed some complicated methods for identifying mismatched datasets within the SOS and GRIN data sources. Not exciting work but very practical.
