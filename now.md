There are multiple deadlines all coming together. Some of these deadlines are real, but most are self-imposed. Timelines that I set a while back, because I believed they were possible. I'm putting in the extra effort now to ensure I live up to those previous commitments. To make sure my word stays true.

These projects include
 - Crop Wild Relative of North America: filling in minor gaps and starting detailed work on the paper
 - Ensuring the gapAnalysisR package is functional and read for github deployment
 - Completing revision of electric charge charging data analysis for CSU alternative transportation group
 - framing conversations for future work within the USDA
	- future climate scenario modeling of an alternative rubber species Guayule
	- Connect bioclimatic predictor data to common garden studies of the phenology of buckwheat.

 It's a testing time on my organization and focus.
