I'm working intently to wrap up some long standing projects to make way for new one. I'm still able to make time each week for writing which is a great feeling.
I'm looking into voice recognition software, trying to determine the value it would bring to my daily work. Basically draft out ideas and emails by speaking through there. It would certainly help keeping writing and editing separated.
I've been using the pomodoro timer for tracking time I spend with emails... Communication is important but seeing big chucks of the day be spent of it is a little disheartening.
