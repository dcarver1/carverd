Summer is in full swing

I went back to CSU campus for the first time since April. It was great to see. Totally empty but still the trees and building all provide a better character for a work place. I guess I'm getting tired of my desk in the corner at home.
Just putting the final touches on a paper and R library for gap analysis R.
The revisions for the CWR of the US paper are taking a lot of time and effort. It's been enjoyable getting to do some more method development but the timeline of the work is pretty taxing.

Current projects
- edits for CWR of USA paper ~ fairly positive review from PNAS which is great
- remote gardening, lol yes, we at least part time :)
