I'm pretty well settled into the remote work process. It is not my favorite. I'm finding it difficult to build and maintain the professional relationships that are part of any work place. I still envision a future where we engage with others on a day to day biases. I don't want to give up on that idea.

Edits for the CWR of the USA paper are in. It was a tremendous amount of work. Now that it's off my plate for a bit I'm able to focus a bit more on other projects. Reproducible reporting for parking and transportation service at CSU, method development for Centroid projects, and this funky data base transformation work for the USDA. Each is a little bit different but that's a good thing in my book.
