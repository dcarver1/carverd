I am wrapping up the big crop wild relative conservation status assessment for the 650 species of North America. Very sortly we will be evaluating this work and writing up methods/conclusion for the paper.

I've been putting a lot of time into creating a R library so others can perform the gapanalysis method that my co-workers and I have been performing over the past few years. It is big learning experience for me and is changing how I think about the writing code.  

Roamresearch.com is a new note taking system that uses a graph database. It is lovely and is becoming my go to source for organization.

swimming, is something new. It awfully enjoyable being underwater.
